That said if you think it learning your voice is creepy then you may want to get something else. Learning your voice allows it to be triggered only when you want to, otherwise it can be triggered by anyone, even tv and movies.

Definitely a Spotify/Echo related issue. 

To top a long unsuccessful afternoon, my Amazon Echo remote no longer works after the factory resets. Very frustrating. Not sure how to factory reset the remote, but too tired to work on it tonight.

The only workaround I've been able to find is instead of using Messaging -> Announce, choose the action as ""Alexa says"".

331,g24l9wj,t3_iclv1f,"As others have said, the answer is ""no"", but here's the fundamental reason:

An Echo device does not perform any speech recognition beyond listening for one of the three wake words (Alexa, Echo, Computer). Once it hears (or thinks it hears) one of those, it records an audio clip of what its microphone picks up afterward. The clip lasts from a second or two before the wake word until it hears silence (there's probably a maximum time to cover the case where someone just keeps talking).

Once the clip has been recorded, it gets sent to Amazon's servers for the actual speech recognition part. The servers translate the speech to text, figure out what you want, and then send a message back to the echo that contains either the spoken response that it is to say or a link to an audio or video stream (alternatively, the message may tell the Echo to do something completely unrelated to what you asked, but that's a different rant).

That whole process is designed to recognize the presence of short commands locally and send them to the server for processing. It would require a fundamental redesign to change the process to ""always listen and interpret"" where continuous voice recognition is happening either locally or on the servers.

As technology progresses, we should expect to see more local complex speech recognition happening on cheap smart speakers like the Echo but I haven't seen any sign that the Alexa architecture is designed in a way that'll accomplish this via a software upgrade (as evidenced by the fact that Amazon still hasn't added any new wake word options since the product line was launched).",t3_iclv1f

Echo Plus and Zigbee devices use *direct* connections.  Then, only the internet connection between the echo and the speech recognition servers at Amazon have to work.

I don't really use it for music though so that could be useful. Likewise I prefer just doing 'OK Google give me directions to...' for whatever reason, I guess because it seems better at getting the search result right.

While a lot of that is true, that's not why they used the name Alexa. Amazon has owned that name for decades at this point, certainly long before thinking to use the name for a voice assistant. I still remember when it was associated with their data collection and analysis services, along with a much-reviled piece of quietly-installed adware. Thankfully, Amazon (and other software giants) changed their privacy policies dramatically since those early days of the commercial Internet.

I could manage my music playback through the Loop as well (through phone + Bluetooth headphones), but I don't, because it controls the streaming music only instead of being integrated with my Amazon Music app, which has my music downloaded for offline playing. (That's a big drawback for me.)

As to what finger to put it on, it has a button to one side that you press to wake the device, so if you can easily reach with your thumb to the base of the finger you would wear it on, you should be fine.",t3_i6ucki
745,g0yeqxl,t3_i6ucki,"I wear mine on my ring finger, and it works rather well. As to whether it's worth the money, that hinges on whether you can work it into your daily routine. 

So far my favorite thing about it is I can use it AND Siri with only one hand, even with my phone in my pocket (Even the Apple Watch is a 2-handed affair, really). Placing or answering a phone call, for example. Getting quick answers to questions even in loud rooms is nice. Getting a regular Echo to answer a question when the music is blasting is a challenge (unless of course the Echo is the source of the music). But with the Loop, just press the button and hold it close to your mouth. It's also much more discrete to hear the answers right in your ear, instead of being broadcast across the room

Definitely takes getting used to, and requires consciously finding ways to use it, but I've found it very satisfying (and cool as heck!)

There are rough edges here and there (for example once I used the Loop to tell my firestick to play music by Mozart while I was playing a game on my iPhone, then the game sound started playing on the Loop!), but this is to be expected with a Day One product and i'm sure they'll address these issues with future updates",t3_i6ucki

819,g0rrijm,t3_i5satv,"You don‚Äôt link Spotify to an echo, you link it to an account. Spotify family isn‚Äôt a good fit for a multi echo environment since Spotify only allows one stream per account, unlike Amazon Music Unlimited family which allows up to six.

The best that can be done in an integrated Alexa environment is to use two adult accounts in an amazon household, with each linked to the corresponding Spotify account, and switch profiles between them as required.

If you want to go further than that with entirely separate Alexa/Spotify account pairs, each with their own registered echos, you‚Äôd lose out on announcements, multi room music groups and simpler smart home device management",t3_i5satv

823,g1dhjy9,t1_g1df7sg,"Yeah, I figured, but better integrated with the Apple ecosystem. I chose Apple Music over Amazon Music Unlimited because I have a ton of Apple devices.. Macs, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, Apple Watches, etc. In particular, Amazon not having an Apple Watch app was a big deal for me because I like to go on runs without my phone and listen to music directly from my watch to my bluetooth headphones.",t3_i5satv
824,g0vx15j,t3_i5omi6,"We‚Äôve had similar issues.  In fact, yesterday I bought a specific mp3 from Amazon so we could add it to a routine.  No matter how I phrased the title in the routine, it played the same completely unrelated audio.  When I pasted the title directly from the Amazon mp3 page, the Alexa app wouldn‚Äôt let me save the routine, saying the song didn‚Äôt exist in their database.  

Audio-wise, we mainly listen to TuneIn non-music stations on Dots anyway but it‚Äôs annoying to know playing music is such a crapshoot.  We try it sometimes with TIDAL and, like you, we end up with wrong versions of any song that might have a cover version so it becomes an exercise in ‚ÄúAlexa stop,‚Äù rinse and repeat.

Then later yesterday I said ‚Äútell ecobee we are leaving‚Äù. This is to put it in away mode which Alexa can accomplish. She cannot seem to accomplish ‚ÄúSleep Mode‚Äù.

1029,g05c1e4,t1_g052lfp,I get what you mean but it‚Äôs hard to have super long led lights. Also I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but no led lights are continuous. Even the ones without alexa capabilities eventually have a maximum amount of length. The more length you want the more power it‚Äôll need take the more power it takes the more expensive it‚Äôll be. Also long led lights aren‚Äôt that great anyway because after about 50 feet you can really notice the energy in the cables degrading. What I‚Äôm saying is that energy won‚Äôt travel that far though the led lights so the further the electricity needs to travel the more power it will lose depending on how far away it is. The science behind this is just that as the power travels farther the power gets lost causing to make your lights a different voltage causing them to be dim which can be very annoying have one side a bright blue while having the other side of your room a dim blue. Though it sounds like it‚Äôs not a big deal after you look at the lights in real life you can really notice it and it will bother you if you care about it (which I do) but if you don‚Äôt mind it then I‚Äôd say yeah go for longer lights but just keep in mind that they might not be as amazing as you expect and you might end up spending a fortune to get those lights. Like my lights where almost $100 to fit all the way around my room and I was very disappointed when I saw that they got dim because of how long the cable is. Also since it takes more power that means more heat. Yes the lights are bright but unfortunately if your not a fan of having your lights heat up your room after a few hours of having the lights on then that would be a con for you.

Contact Tech support and ask them specifically to clear your saved wifi information on the on your account.

Have you change wifi routers recently? If yes, Make sure your wifi settings is set to DHCP not Static.

Wifi modems also has OTA pushed by your ISP. Some settings may change after the update check it.

Once you have confirmed DHCP settings on your modem and you owned multiple echo devices on your household; shut off devices that are already connected. Then do the setup with device in question.

This is a common problem with 1st Gen Echo, 1st and 2nd Gen echo dots, if you got the recent model, youre good. Problem is really on your wifi settings.

If these troubleshooting wont solve it. The 15% discount offered to you is out OOW (Out of Warranty Promotion) that counts on your next echo purchase. Your device is subject to trade-in. You can get another 25% discount plus a trade-in value of $10 (depending how pristine your device we can give you higher trade/in value. You can use both 15% discount and 25% together in one purchase.

You said you are not interested in DROPPING IN on them but you would like to ‚Äúintercom‚Äù back and forth. The DROP IN feature is an Intercom feature. It is the same thing on a Echo without a screen like Echo Dots. On any device with a screen DROP IN also allows you to see the person. But it is a meant to be used as an intercom. The Announcement feature is a broadcasting feature. If you want to contact them individually you would use DROP IN. You can connect your Apple subscription. My knowledge on Apple Music is very limited. Therefore, I don‚Äôt know if each child will be able to listen simultaneously on their respective devices. I know with Amazon Music Unlimited and Spotify they have family plans that allow simultaneous listening. Perhaps Apple Music has something similar. Check further into that. If you disable DROP IN on one device it is disabled period no one will be able to Drop In on that device. 

You can limit DROP IN to just household members. Meaning no one outside of your Amazon account will be able to Drop In on your home. This feature can be configured on each device. There are 3 setting with regard to DROP IN. 1) ON, 2) HOUSEHOLD ONLY 3) OFF

IMPORTANT NOTE: DROP IN & Calling, Messaging must first be enabled and then when it comes to DROP IN you must grant permission to each person outside of your household to DROP IN on your household devices. Likewise they must grant you permission. It is a two way street. You also must grant yourself permission for your own household devices. If you plan on putting smart plugs and like in each child‚Äôs room. I am not aware of a way to prevent one child from turning on/off the other‚Äôs light. Why because the lights are associated to account registered on the Echo. Both Echo Dots will be registered to your Amazon account so will the lights. As a matter of fact, Amazon just recently released an update. You can now set up an alarm and/or reminder from one device to go off on another device. 

Now if you want each kid to be able to access his/her devices Only. Then create an Amazon account for each kid. Connect the lights in their respective rooms to their account. You can configure it on your phone or on each of their iPads. You can still access their accounts by logging in with their Amazon credentials in the app on your phone. Just make sure they don‚Äôt change the passwords on you. This option will prevent each kid from messing with the other‚Äôs settings. However for you it will require signing in and out of each child‚Äôs account in order to see what they are doing. If you have an iPad you could keep one child‚Äôs Alexa signed in and on your iPhone keep the other child‚Äôs account signed in so you will be able to check without having to sign in and out.",t3_i0cj4j

1280,fzic9g5,t3_hz7t2t,"what do you want to be able to say?

""turn off the third floor hallway light"" seems fine assuming you want to be that specific

you can create groups for hallway (does all lights in the all the hallways (i am assuming 3) or a group for ""first floor"", though that does confuse things, does that mean all the lights on the first floor?

but if you have three floors, each with a hallway light, how else are you going to specify which floor and which light you want to turn off/on other than ""turn off the first/second/third floor hallway light""",t3_hz7t2t
1281,fzk9oxs,t3_hz7t2t,"I made a routine to turn off all of my lights, just make a routine and include the lights you want in it. When you say ""Alexa, turn off third floor"" she'll use that routine you made to do it.",t3_hz7t2t

1283,fzigdse,t1_fzhvp5r,it wont let me add an alexa device to it thats in another room. and the microphones arent precise enough that putting one in the hallway wouldnt activate the ones in the rooms.,t3_hz7t2t
1284,fzig4qf,t1_fzic9g5,thats why id like a floors option. just like how i have multiple lights but if i just say ‚Äúturn on the lights‚Äù it turns only the ones in the room im in on. also itd make it easier to find devices quickly if i could go by floor. and frankly ‚Äúfloor>room>device‚Äù is just a naturally intuitive organization system for me.,t3_hz7t2t
1285,fzn26ne,t1_fzml4ro,i have an alexa routine for that. it works when it wants to. im aware that i can make routines for these things i just want it to be intuitive in the same way rooms commands are. especially because the strictness of commands makes it difficult to consistently remember the correct command when theres 25 of them. and the other house members would have to learn them all too. it comes down to the way the human brain stores and assimilates information. routines require you to learn a new way of doing something whereas room integration just requires you to remember that alexa can do something. furthermore there are linguistic difficulties that occur with a rigid command structure. my mother calls it ‚Äúhall light‚Äù i call it the hallway . depending on the person the way theyd refer to the room changes.,t3_hz7t2t
1286,fzkr0az,t1_fzigdse,"Hmm... I have a device group (Insteon devices) that's available to all Alexa devices. 

For example, I'll have a group ""Outdoor Lights"" that includes a porch light, garage light, and sidewalk.  I can tell any Alexa ""turn on outdoor lights"" and it will sequentially turn on the porch, garage and sidewalk.",t3_hz7t2t
1287,fzii6rh,t1_fzig4qf,"so you would group multiple echo devices into the same ""floor"" and if you say ""turn on the hallways lights"" to any of the echo devices on the third floor, it would know you were on the third floor so it is the third floor hallway lights it needed to turn on, and not any of the others?

I can see that could be useful. Though at the moment she is so crappy, i am 1 meter away from the full sized echo in the kitchen, she hears the command, but it is the dot, in the other room, around a corner, behind a bookcase that actions it. Stupid alexa :)",t3_hz7t2t
1288,fzj5kzf,t1_fzii6rh,i would say ‚Äúmaybe the microphone?‚Äù but if one more article recommends that to me imma scream ü§£.  but yeah i feel like floors would be really helpful (especially for the SAF and the HMAF {housemate approval factor} who might not be there when the naming is done) the closer you can get to whatd be yelled to somebody ‚Äú turn off the bathroom light!‚Äù is something anyone would ask of another person.i wouldnt tell somebody two feet from the second flr bathroom to ‚Äúturn of the third floor bathroom light‚Äù because id assume they already knew,t3_hz7t2t

In all the time I‚Äôve been using the app I‚Äôve always seen that giant button there at the bottom but I never knew what it was, and never even thought it was a button. I also never knew you could talk to the app so it didn‚Äôt occur to me to use the app in that way. 

Maybe it‚Äôs a use case driven issue. whenever i open the app it‚Äôs with a specific purpose in mind that, such as changing the wifi network for a device, or using drop-in. 

But the row of icon buttons with text, and the giant Alexa icon with no text right in the middle made it look like it was just a logo. Since the other buttons had text to explain but that one didn‚Äôt, I didn‚Äôt think it was a button, and there was no indication that I could talk to the app, so it never occurred to me to look for a button to do that. 

Now, the new version of the app, the Alexa button is on its own row, and has text underneath that says ‚ÄúTalk to Alexa‚Äù which is much more clear.",t3_hz3sly
1303,fzh8hkj,t1_fzgtikd,Agreed. Smart home management of more than a few devices is excruciating... if they can fix smart home management I might reconsider purchasing HomePod minis when Apple releases them and completely ditching amazon smart home. But that‚Äôs a big maybe.,t3_hz3sly

My solution was to go into the Pandora app or website and rename my station to ‚ÄúMy Zero 7 radio‚Äù and ask Alexa by the new name. (It won‚Äôt work to delete or rename the undesirable station because it will just create it again every time you ask.)

It‚Äôs a workaround but it solved my problem.",t3_hyzwlj

We have long conversations that have been hilarious. But it was Google Assistant that was put in the Hopper3s when she replied to me when I told her to FO. She replied, ""I can't do that.............yet."" I wish I had a recording of that. It couldn't be any better.",t3_hyehj9
1363,fzch8at,t1_fzcatzn,"I am generally happy with her, and with Amazon.   However as a software dev myself I *FEEL* that they are lacking in the understanding of phrases a bit.

eg: I have one routine that is called by; ""Alexa, turn down service"" and on MANY occasions she has replied with; ""I don't understand 'down stairs'""   I get that she is hearing ""down stairs"" instead of ""down service"", but the number of syllable in just those two words are off, as is the number of words.   She is also not taking into account when I say; ""NO""  ""STOP"" and then repeat what I am saying.

It SEEMS that their AI is not learning about the false responses to improve...  however, since I no nothing of how their tech works, I don't know wtf I am talking about.

Still, it's much better than others, and MUCH better than it has been in past decades.   I have half dozen different tech company products all tied into Alexa and most of the time it works great.  When it doesn't it seems that it is the fault of the hardware vendor, not Amazon.",t3_hyehj9

Had some issues with my router seeing my cable modem so the cable modem gets another reboot and boom I've got internet again. Then I turned on each Alexa device (I have 5 in my home) one at a time. I then played a song on each one before I plugged the next one back in, just to make sure it had time to completely boot up and show it could play a song from Spotify.

After all were booted back up I logged back into the Alexa app, went to groups, clicked ""Everywhere"" then edited that group and was able to readd the missing devices back to the group. Everything works like it should now.

Over the past two days I have caught my Ring Doorbell, Amazon Firesticks, and Alexa Devices doing the same thing.

&#x200B;

I have a Pihole that blocks DNS connections to websites where I don't want my information being shared. I have caught multiple Amazon devices attempting to bypass my DNS blocking and trying to get the DNS information on their own by visiting:

&#x200B;

[dns.google.com](https://dns.google.com) (Google's public DNS server - This is the biggest offender)

[192.168.49.1](https://192.168.49.1) (The default IP for Linksys Routers)

[192.168.1.2](https://192.168.1.2) (The default IP for a wide variety of Routers)

&#x200B;

By using [dns.google.com](https://dns.google.com) a device can get the IP address of the server where it's trying to send your personal information and bypass any blocking you have in place. When it tries to connect to [192.168.49.1](https://192.168.49.1) and [192.168.1.2](https://192.168.1.2) it is trying to connect directly to the IP addresses most commonly used by consumer routers. Since I changed the IP range for my network those IPs don't exist, Amazon has programming that tries likely IP addresses hoping to blend in with normal traffic. However because those addresses don't exist on my network it stands out immediately. Earleir this week I also caught my \[Firestick joining the open guest network\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/hrdh1p/if\_you\_have\_a\_firestick\_it\_will\_try\_to\_use\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/comments/hrdh1p/if_you_have_a_firestick_it_will_try_to_use_an/)) to try and get around my blocking.

&#x200B;

Why This Matters

These are your devices, you paid for them, and they are on your network, they should follow the rules you have put in place, and not try and sneakily find a way out, without you knowing. Earlier this year the \[Ring App was caught sharing it's users data with Facebook\]([https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-29/ring-app-shares-personal-data-eff-finds](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-01-29/ring-app-shares-personal-data-eff-finds)). Why are the devices you purchased spying on you and sending your data to third parties, and why are they sneaking around looking for holes in your network to do it?

&#x200B;

Beware The Amazon Attack Shills

This is not the first post I've made exposing Amazon's shady and invasive networking practices. I caught my \[Amazon Echo trying to send data to Spotify even though I don't have a Spotify account\]([https://reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/hs0bpk/why\_is\_my\_alexa\_device\_trying\_to\_send\_data\_to/](https://reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/hs0bpk/why_is_my_alexa_device_trying_to_send_data_to/)). Because \[Amazon customers who own an Alexa device spend 29% more than the average customer\]([https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/05/30/40k-person-study-buying-echo-increases-amazon-purchases-29-especially-cpg-items/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2018/05/30/40k-person-study-buying-echo-increases-amazon-purchases-29-especially-cpg-items/)) they probably don't want people to know their devices are spying on them, and are using extremely questionable tactics to bypass any network blocking rules their customers may have put in place. So what happens next is the attack shills come in and try to dog-pile on this thread creating as much infighting as possible to try and force the moderators to remove the thread. If you don't believe online attack shills are really a thing here's an article explaining \[how attack trolling works\]([https://medium.com/@danbarber\_12163/the-guide-to-effectively-fighting-fud-417d2340678a](https://medium.com/@danbarber_12163/the-guide-to-effectively-fighting-fud-417d2340678a)) and here's another article explaining some of the \[tactics attack shills use to get people banned and threads removed\]([https://advertiserblocklist.com/paid-shills-attack-agents/](https://advertiserblocklist.com/paid-shills-attack-agents/)). I'm completely fine with the thread being locked to prevent that situation. I've been online for a very long time and know exactly how the game is played.

One of the most popular features of ICMP is a ""ping,"" a small packet that the remote server responds to with a message equivalent to ""I'm here."" Google's DNS server has such a large uptime that it's considered always up, and it handles enough normal queries that they don't care if you ping them.

Amazon is pinging Google DNS to see if you have an internet connection. If the Google DNS server responds to the ping, you have a connection. If not, you likely don't. That's all it's doing.

Just to be certain, what I would do is say to her ""What is this device's name?"" or ""What is this device called?"". Once you're sure of what that device's name is, go into the Alexa app and go to Settings > Device Settings > [the name she just said] > Device Location, and make sure there's something listed there.

It's possible that you put in a location, but you didn't click ""save"", or something else went wrong. It's possible that you're somehow logged into the wrong account, or editing the location for the wrong device. Note that the ""Your Locations"" section of the app is not enough, as the device itself needs a location as well, via the instructions I listed above.

If that doesn't work, you're going to want to unplug it and plug it back in.

If neither of these things work, your best bet is going to be to press and hold the button on top with the single dot on it, for about 25 seconds, to perform a factory reset, and then try setting it up again from the beginning.

If you're unwilling to do a factory reset, let us know and I guess we can come up with some other random guesses. You could also try going into the app and going to Help > Chat with us. They can probably tell you what to do or even fix it for you.",t3_hs9mis

If you look just to the right of the magnifying glass do you see an ""EN"" icon? Can you click it and change it to FR?

I thought if every night I give a routine to turn off all lights etc and I do not do that at some point Alexa would ask if I forgot or if I want to do that now.....I have never received a hunch for that.

Then, as others have said, create a group (""Kitchen"") and add the appropriate Alexa device(s) to that group.

1978,fxxy49e,t1_fxxrwjn,"Yes, can confirm. If your echo device is assigned to a room and the lights you want to control are assigned to that same room, it works as OP desires.

We had two Wemo Switch outlets connected to lamps, in a ‚Äúliving room‚Äù group, so ‚Äúturn on the living room‚Äù always turned on the lights.

Anyway, in your groups, change the switch type to ""light"" in the device settings within the Alexa app. That will tell Alexa that the switch controls a light. The groups are location sensitive so if the Echo for example in a ""family room"" group also has 2 switches that control a light and a smart bulb for a total of 3 lights, you can say ""Alexa, turn on the lights"". If in the family room and that Echo device is the one that hears your command, it knows to turn on those 3 lights in that room.",t3_hq2e8n

I have six Echo Link Amps installed in my network rack, linked to the echo device in each of those zones. When the system works, it‚Äôs great. But yesterday I noticed that the amps were all showing as offline in the Alexa app. 

I thought that it might be because the Amazon account password had been changed, but even after factory resetting and deregistering and then starting from scratch... they were showing as offline within minutes. 

Eventually, I disconnected the ethernet connections to the amps and now they seem to be responding to voice commands. Since they were not connected to my wired network when I set them up the first time (when they worked as expected), I‚Äôm wondering if the ethernet port on these things is just for show or what.

Consider taking a look at your [Devices page](https://www.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/alldevices) in Amazon. If I'm not mistaken, the only places an announcement can originate from are Amazon Alexa devices, third-party Alexa devices, and devices with the Alexa app installed.

Unfortunately, this page will provide you with about 10 million old phones, and old installations on the same phone, with no particular indication of which phone it was or when or how it last accessed your account. If you have tons of old phones on this list and want to deregister them but you don't know what your current ones are named, you can ask ""what is this device called?"" in the Alexa app on your current phones.

If it was a robot voice TTS announcement rather than a voice clip (which I think you're saying as the case?), I believe it could only have come from the Alexa app. There is no place anywhere in the site or the app where you can see where a TTS app announcement came from. All voice announcements will appear in the voice history somewhere.

I would consider asking support, under Help > Chat with us, if I were you. They may have access to additional account history items that you are not able to view.

2245,fxa2897,t3_hn7jl8,"Since you‚Äôre using this for TV and Movie watching I would probably go with the Sonos package because it will give you a centre channel with the sound bar so it would essentially be a 3.1 system and that is important because all of the dialogue comes out of the centre channel. If this was an AVR based system I would say that 2.1 (the echo setup) would be ok but that‚Äôs because AVR‚Äôs can create phantom centre channels with stereo speakers, the echo‚Äôs won‚Äôt do that so all of your movies and tv will be in stereo which just isn‚Äôt going to sound good. The echo speakers are decent speakers, I have a couple of the 3rd gens in my kitchen and they sound great, like surprisingly great but I personally can‚Äôt imagine watching a movie in stereo because there will be no difference between where the dialog comes from and where all the other sounds come from so for this reason I would go with the Sonos. 

I also just want to mention that you say you want to stay wireless but you still have to plug in everything so it‚Äôs not really wireless anyways. It‚Äôs worth your time to put your budget out there and ask over at r/hometheater just to see what you could get because speaker cable is easier to run than power cords, especially in a 3.1 system and you can still plug a dot in and get all the smart benefits but with better sound. Just don‚Äôt mention sound bars in that sub, it‚Äôs like dropping Android in a Mac sub. Seriously though, it is worth your time just to ask.",t3_hn7jl8

All the Amazon devices are linked to play media through the Sonos device in the same room and it works like a charm. 

As someone else mentioned: the Sonos One does not allow full Alexa functionality, something I found out when I tried to make more Alexa Routines and it replied it is unable to do routines. 

The sound and the bass on the Sonos is so impressive, our upstairs neighbour complained about the bass several times, even when the volume was very low, and we had to turn the bass and treble down. 

As others have said: if you are looking into creating a sound system mainly for home theatre purposes, the Sonos will definitely make all the difference. For full use of Alexa and/or multi-room usage, I would recommend an integration of both systems.

I primary used my echos for alarms, timers, weather, and playing music from Spotify.  In my experience the Sonos are vastly superior for sound quality and reliability.  They just work.   My Echos work most of the time but randomly choose to drop out while playing music, or to simply not play at all.  Wait 10 minutes and they'll start working again.   And one time, I tried setting up two identical 2nd gen echos as a stereo pair.  I gave up after two weeks.  It simply never worked for more than 5 minutes at a time.   I still use my Echos and have no plans to get rid of them.  But for my main living space, it's only Sonos from this point on.

2248,fxbnpg0,t3_hn7jl8,"I currently have a 5 Zone Sonos setup and I am replacing it with an Amazon Echo setup.

Sonos ended support for their 1st generation products making them incompatible with newer Sonos products forcing me to replace them. For a $3k setup, that sucks. I don't thin I'll ever buy Sonos again.

I looked at the Amazon ONE but found it expensive and reviews were mixed. For a multi-room setup, the cost of the alternatives are:

* Sonos $325 (6x Sonos AMP at $650)
* Echo Links: $1,500 (6x Amazon Echo Link at $299)
* Echo + Amp: $750 (Dayton 12 channel Amplifier for $500, 5x Echo Dot for $250)

The system isn't fully working yet, but from an initial test the sound quality is more than good enough with my ceiling speakers. If you have $5000 speakers, it would be a different discussion.

But the main advantage I see with this setup is that I can replace streaming and Amplifier separately. Amplifiers evolve slowly (this one may last 10-20 years). But if Amazon end-of-lifes their Echo's I only have to replace $250 worth of gear as opposed to $3000 worth of gear with Sonos.

Charles will capture the packets that go in and out of your phone. When you click on ""feed the pet"" in the Alexa app, your phone will definitely send something somewhere, and Charles will definitely find it.

This is where my unfamiliarity comes into play though. It seems to me like there's a chance that the particular packet that actually contains the command you're looking for never passes through your phone. As if your phone is literally just saying to Amazon ""feed the pet"", and then Amazon's cloud server translates that into the full API command, which your phone never gets to see.

From looking at your post history, it seems to me as if what you were attempting to do already should have been on the right track. You already managed to capture the API request from the feeder's app and stuff. That seems like it's going to be a much more useful avenue than trying to bring Alexa into the mix.",t3_hmvh9w

I used Charles and did find all the command details being sent from the Petkit App to the Petkit feeder. Unfortunately my Json.config in Homebridge (Raspberry Pi) doesn‚Äôt work. The icon does appear in the Home App but nothing happens when I clicked on the newly created ¬´¬†stateless¬†¬ª switch in the Apple Home App. 

After trying many times with different configurations I thought I‚Äôd try a different approach: Alexa. The Petkit App connects to Alexa and can be commanded with a Skill in the Alexa App. You might be right and the command might bypass my phone though. I thought that by looking at the command Alexa sends to the feeder I would find the right json.config. Additional note: it‚Äôs just a Skill in the app and not a switch, I‚Äôm new with Alexa and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to transform a Skill (here only a voice command apparently) into a switch in the app.

Once it does happen, you're correct, unplugging the device seems to reset it.  However the device usually (for me) comes back eventually (hours?) on its own.

Try this: next time it happens, I pull up weather (Alexa, what's the weather).  I get a visual response on my show but now voice.  Then I ask for a joke.  That will come back with Audio.  Again, I don't know what's happening or why but the device isn't actually on mute (I can hear the joke).  My research online hasn't been very fruitful.  Just my observations.

2317,fx4efp6,t1_fx22obf,So good thanks!,t3_hlumbk
2318,fxgdo92,t1_fx4efp6,Let me explain further. You have to put those lights in a group with the Echo. For instance the Smart Lights in your Kitchen put them into a Smart Home group with the Echo device. Once in the same group. Just say Alexa Lights off. It knows those are the lights you are referring to.,t3_hlumbk
2319,fxjf8e7,t1_fxgdo92,"Great that makes sense, what about more specific though, like say I have a ceiling light in the living room, a lamp and a Hue lightstrip.  Normally I'd be saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"" or ""Alexa, turn off the living room lightstrip.""  Can I instead just call those lamp or lightstrip, so if I'm in the living room and say ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" or ""Alexa, turn off the lightstrip"" she would do it?  Where as if I have the same config in the bedroom, I could walk in the bedroom and say to the Alexa there ""Alexa, turn on the lightstrip?""  Or is it more like all or nothing, like turning on ALL the lights in this group?

My main goal is I want to walk into a bedroom for example and say ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" vs ""the guest bedroom lamp"", or ideally have custom phrases like ""Alexa, evening lightning"" where if I'm in the bedroom that triggers ""evening lighting"" for that room, and if I'm in the living room it triggers ""evening lighting"" for that room as well.",t3_hlumbk
2320,fyfq541,t1_fxjf8e7,In my Master Bedroom. I have a Chandelier with Smart Bulbs and a lamp that is plugged into a Smart Plug. The group name is Master Bedroom. When I say lights on just the Chandelier comes on. But when I say turn on Master both the lamp and the chandelier comes on. If I just want the lamp. I have to specify Bedroom Lamp. Because I have two other Lamps elsewhere in the house also plugged into Smart Plugs. If I just say lamp. Alexa will say which lamp you have several items with the name lamp. I truly hope some day Amazon will add something to make the Echoes a bit more aware of the items in that room. Regardless of what they are. I guess your best bet would be to create a Routine so you could get your Evening lights to come on. You might have to create a Routine for the bedroom and one for the living room.

2496,fwhdq0p,t3_him73r,"The day routines became insanely good is when I figured out how to use IFTTT triggers to cause an Alexa routine.  (You can already cause IFTTT actions, but not have IFTTT cause routines, that is more complex)

Alexa already has locations as triggers for one person but not for multiple.  This is frustrating for automatons that involve the rest of my family.

So, using Life 360 in Ifttt, I have a routine that is triggered by EVERYONE in the house leaving or the FIRST family member arriving back home is a trigger.

Then once that routine is triggered, it's a bunch of normal things like cameras, locks, lights, temperature (using Ifttt as an action not the trigger, but that's already built in.)

So, the routine itself is fairly normal, but the hugely important part is that I have Life 360 as the trigger for the routine.  I do this using a SmartThings virtual sensor which is the middle man between Ifttt and Alexa.  It makes the Alexa system nearly perfect as I can combine all the amazing delays and easy to use smart home gadgets, with the 3rd party actions of Ifttt such as cameras arming and disarming, and smart thermostats using more than just a temperature change but a comfort profile being set for a certain amount of hours (etc.)

ADDITIONALLY, I use this method to have a routine trigger other routines.  Which is useful for controlling the volume on multiple echos simultaneously with one routine phrase, in my case, ""Reset Echo Volume"" Which then sets all my echos in the house to a predetermined volume (since my kid messes up the volume throughout the day listening to music on a bunch of different echos)",t3_him73r

I figured, ""okay, just set up one for each day and have it repeat, so only seven to do.""  BUT, when I select Every whateverday, there's no available option to repeat hourly.  Essentially, if I set it to repeat Every Monday, I can only set it for a single time.  No other options are available.

> **Your random number** between 1 and 1,000,000,000,000 **is** 617,137,991,774.

If you pick an insane range, she changes the format of the reply. ""Alexa, pick a number between one and four hundred trillion.""

> **Here's a number** between 1 and 400000000000000: **it's** 1.

However! Here's what she did when I used a *slightly* less absurd range. ""Alexa, pick a number between one and two trillion"":

> Here's a number between 1 and 2000000000000: it's 1.

> Here's a number between 1 and 2000000000000: it's 1.

> Here's a number between 1 and 2000000000000: it's 621772209367.

For ""two trillion"" she kept doing the ""1"" thing for a while, but then it eventually worked and she actually gave me a real number. I cannot get her to do this for ""four hundred trillion"" though.

Here's a third way she can reply. ""Alexa, give me a number between three trillion and four trillion"":

> **A randomly chosen number is** 3413528254893.

My conclusion is that Alexa seems to use completely different functions depending on the range she's being asked to operate on. I'm not an amazing programmer, but this makes sense to me.

Her ""**your** random number between"" and ""**a** random number"" functions seem to be working properly. Her ""**here's** a number between"" function seems to have some kind of programming error in it that makes it fail occasionally and default to ""1"", perhaps if the number it picks is too big.

I personally like devices that can do both so when the internet, server, or hub are down, they can alternate to whatever is working, but those are pricier.

But I will also add, that I've had mixed luck hiding alexa devices, becuase their microphone arrays do not like to be blocked very much.

I‚Äôm probably missing one or two things in that list.

But my biggest problem is that, since we added a FireTV Cube in my son‚Äôs room to control his TV, the Echo Show in the living room will no longer use the Harmony remote skill to control the entertainment center.

Or say: ""Alexa, ask Samuel L Jackson to wikipedia fiscal policy"" (Replace ""fiscal policy"" with any wikipedia article title)

Also don‚Äôt add the WeMo skill through alexa.  Have SmartThings do it.  But add it to HomeKit if it‚Äôs possible

With the hue skill you can add it to Alexa (again only the hue groups).  But when adding from SmartThings don‚Äôt add hue bulbs from the device list.  I would say have SmartThings do the hue bulbs too but I‚Äôm not sure if you can change their colour with voice that way or not.

2896,fwfs2im,t1_fvqgfk4,"For what it's worth, here's what I did and what happened.

I deleted the Wemo and Philips Hue skills. I deleted the duplicate entries that weren't affiliated with SmartThings. I lost any Hue rooms, groups or scenes. I could turn the bulbs on and off etc, but not in batches as I had previously. I ended up adding that skill back, hoping Alexa would ask me what components to add, but it just added everything wholesale.

A typical bulb now shows up 4 times!  
Example:  
Corner Lamp SmartThings Light (dimmable)	  
Corner Lamp SmartThings Light  
Corner Lamp Dimmable Light  
Corner Lamp Royal Philips Electronics smart device

Wemo didn't go away, even without the skill. I still have 3 entries, all slightly different.  
Example:  
Entry Lamp SmartThings Device  
Entry Lamp WeMo Switch  
Entry Lamp Wemo Plug

I think Alexa is actually scanning the house, without the skill, and finding them.

My plan is to keep swapping them out for SmartThings Z Wave parts anyway, although that won't fix the Hue issue. But at least those work reliably.",t3_hdvx7y

With the lights tied in to Home Assistant, it's just a matter of setting up the right automation to control this.

Home Assistant is the 'brain' of my home integration. Through it, I can have Alexa say to close the patio door if it stays open for too long and it's hotter outside (my Acurite weather station is tied to Home Assistant) than inside (thermostats are also tied to Home Assistant).

I also have Alexa warn incomers to wash their hands by tying my Ring door bell and alarm system to Home Assistant. That way, I know if the door is opened by someone coming in (movement detected by the door bell before the door opens) and it doesn't play that line if someone is going out.

Just like for the 'dinner is ready' automation, it also works the other way. My Alexa good night routine talks to Home Assistant. Through it, my Weiser Door Lock locks the door, arms my DSC alarm system and sets the light for bed mode.

There are two components that the Alexa team doesn't control, that the music service provider does (in this case Spotify).

First, the MSP is the one that sends their catalog to Alexa.  This supplies the list of songs available for Alexa to play.  

Next, Alexa then takes all of the search hits and creates a score of what you likely asked for and sends this to the MSP's delta as a ""search"" which connects to the MSP's external APIs which then do all of their internal magic.  The MSP returns a streamable link (or set of links if you asked for an album, playlist, etc.) that goes back to a play queue and your devices begins to play music.  Usually.

If no search hits happened or if no results were returned you will get the ""I can't find songs by X on Spotify"" error.",t3_hdnjc7

2945,fvjzqhc,t3_hdapdz,I thought my phone was crap. My Alexa app freezes rabdomly too.,t3_hdapdz
2946,fvk6t9h,t3_hdapdz,It has gotten better. Imagine how bad it was before? I don‚Äôt understand why a company like Amazon would not invest in their native mobile experience. The whole Alexa system seems to be going downhill.,t3_hdapdz
2947,fvkffnl,t3_hdapdz,"So is the echo show UI. I can‚Äôt believe how clunky, slow and the very little features it has. The actual touch screen is unusable.

2948,fvl37kx,t3_hdapdz,Anyone else take screenshots of your grocery list before you head into a grocery store because the Alexa app is such dog shit that you found it easier to look at an image than trying to rely on the app to see what you need to get?,t3_hdapdz

2950,fvkq6ma,t3_hdapdz,"My biggest complaint is the UI is not consistent. some setting save automatically, a lot others you have to actually explicitly press the save button to store a change. It's pretty maddening. Why can't I search for music, either?",t3_hdapdz
2951,fvk4x8j,t3_hdapdz,"What if I told you that Alexa in general is crap? Been using it for a couple years now. The improvements are minimal at best. The app is only a piece of the larger problem. Alexa is a sales vehicle, not a personal assistant. Amazon needs to figure out whether they want short term sales or long term, heavily invested customers. So far, it‚Äôs the former.",t3_hdapdz
2952,fvkc39k,t3_hdapdz,Yes I agree with this I always thought it was my phone and have been meaning to ask this subreddit what the deal is with their android app. Google assistant is fantastic but I have none of their devices. I'm fully Alexa,t3_hdapdz
2953,fvtilor,t3_hdapdz,"This is so damn true. Alexa works pretty well on my echo dot and I expected atleast a similar experience in the alexa app. But as soon as I started using the app itself I understood that it is very buggy. Honestly it feels like a beta version! Literally everything is slow. Even on my phone with Snapdragon 865, after clicking a button I have to wait 2 seconds before anything happens. So I decided to check it in my mom's phone which is much slower. As expected the experience was so bad that a user will never use that app again. 
If I want to invoke a skill, usually in echo devices I can just say, 'open skill name', this used to work in the app also, until they suddenly decided to change it. One day suddenly, when I said 'open skill name', it is searching for that skill name in Google Play Store! I was not understanding what is happening, after contacting Amazon customer care I got to know that they changed the way how we invoke skill in app and now with every invocation, we have to add 'skill' in the end, so it's like 'open <skill name> skill'.
They don't seem to care about the app at all. It crashes more than every other app I have in the phone. Alexa app is important for anyone who has an alexa device to do various things. I wish Amazon fixes it!",t3_hdapdz
2954,fvkjtcc,t3_hdapdz,"Glad to know it's not just me. I get depressed every time I have to open the Alexa app. I kinda have Alexa app PTSD. I use the webapp whenever I can.

my echo show sits on my side table and i more or less never use the touch screen. i bought it to replace my google home hub, and yet several months later the home hub is still sitting on my desk, muted, so i can tap and poke it to control smart home stuff when i'm on my computer.",t3_hdapdz

2981,fvkkerc,t1_fvkffig,"I'm no expert on the topic, but I think the majority of Android apps are written entirely or mostly in Java, as well as large parts of the Android OS itself. Java is considered to be a pretty great language these days, and you can use it all day long without even knowing it.

Java has a bad rap because during its heyday we only ever saw it through hideous web applets that had to be run in a very slow local virtual machine, and it was objectively all-around pretty terrible, and that's how we'll all remember it forever.

But something else is wrong with the Alexa app. Something very, very wrong.",t3_hdapdz
2982,fvla25j,t1_fvkffig,"As mentioned, Java has nothing to do with issues.

I can build you a fully functional app in Java, C++, C#, Kotlin, or assembly, and you would have no idea which is which.",t3_hdapdz
2983,fvlg4l8,t1_fvl9fsb,I'm glad I got my parents the Google Home.,t3_hdapdz
2984,fvl315p,t1_fvkkerc,Java has nothing to do with it. I believe it's that it is basically a shell application which caches almost no data locally and relies 100% on web services to do everything.,t3_hdapdz
2985,fvlk44g,t1_fvl315p,"I agree, but I feel like something else also has to be wrong with it on top of this. The Alexa web site (alexa.amazon.com) is lightning fast compared to the app. How much difference in overhead can there be between displaying an HTML page, vs performing some kind of XMLHttpRequest and rendering the results into a list?

Out of curiosity, I just ran a packet capture app on my phone to check out all of the information that the Alexa app (and only the Alexa app) sends back and forth. All I did was load the app, go into my device settings, and turn ""follow up mode"" on and then back off.

One connection (44kb) includes the names of hundreds of Pokemon, comic book, and video game characters. Ekans, Wartortle, Raticate, Beedrill, Ultron, Thor, Mystique, Samus, Yoshi, Zelda, and plenty of others. (I get that these are just code names for features, [but lol](https://i.imgur.com/sieNmHp.png).)

One connection (222kb) contains the names and metadata for hundreds or perhaps thousands of radio stations.

One connection (36kb) contains all of the complete metadata for every single skill I have enabled.

Dozens of connections (between 16kb and 261kb) were just indecipherable base64-encoded data that my phone uploaded to Amazon.

One connection was a 5mb upload to http:\//device-metrics-us-2.amazon.com/ and contained nothing but text information about my phone...",t3_hdapdz

2987,fvv4ixh,t1_fvu66eo,"I used an app on Android that's actually just called [Packet Capture](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.sslcapture).

Anyway, the only way I know how to fix it is to turn everything off and start again. So that's router, Devolo homeplug network and Echos all off and then switch them all back on starting from the router down. Once the router is back on move to the next level etc.

But it's very finicky.

For example, when the Echo last played Amazon music, ""Alexa continue playing on the Living Room"" will have the living room echo pick up the Amazon music where it left off! 
You can seem to avoid it by specifying ""Alexa continue playing Spotify on Living Room.""
Even then, sometimes Alexa simply does nothing until tell her the same command a few more times.

At any rate, being able to voice control Spotify and even switch the playback device is a huge plus. Otherwise I'd have had to turn on my mobile device, fire up the Spotify app and change the playback device from the screen.

3038,fvgpy8z,t1_fvgmp0h,They could just take no action. Also isn't this reminder focuses on problematic families? You won't forget father's day when you have a healthy relationship with your father. I'm just saying.,t3_hcpisw
3039,fvfs0bs,t3_hclxtw,Battery?,t3_hclxtw
3040,fvg2a1p,t3_hclxtw,I have got both an Ecolink Tilt and Samsung multisensor and neither of them work as a garage sensor. Both Alexa and Smart hub sees the status change but Alexa does nothing with them.,t3_hclxtw
3041,fvgxd64,t3_hclxtw,The Smartthings skill for Alexa stopped working a couple weeks ago just for Alexa routines.,t3_hclxtw

3043,fvfsaqj,t1_fvfs0bs,They look good the whole house stoped working  all on the same day with no charges ondone by me.,t3_hclxtw
3044,fvfwcvy,t1_fvfsaqj,My guess would be either the camera or the bridge then. I would try unplugging the bridge and plugging it back in. If that doesn‚Äôt work you could try unplugging the camera and plugging it back in.,t3_hclxtw
3045,fvfngzd,t3_hclfeg,"I‚Äôm an avid Alexa user, with Dots and Echoes scattered throughout my house with various devices connected to them from lights to my thermostat, and even my insulin pump (via IFTTT triggers). About a year ago, I requested an invite to order Echo Frames to take Alexa capabilities on the go, and yesterday I finally received them. They happen to use the same size lenses as my normal glasses, so I swapped them out to give them a try today. Got questions about them? Ask away, and I‚Äôll try to answer!",t3_hclfeg
3046,fvfurn1,t3_hclfeg,How much close people need to hear Alexa replying or people around can‚Äôt hear?,t3_hclfeg
3047,fvfyhab,t3_hclfeg,So you were able to get your prescription lenses into them?,t3_hclfeg
3048,fvgfzyx,t3_hclfeg,"So these are basically Bluetooth earphones turned into glasses? I mean, it still requires a phone running the Alexa app, right?

Do you have to delay a moment or two after saying the wake word? I found this to be the case with the Echo Auto, which sort of ruins the experience.

How's battery life?",t3_hclfeg
3049,fvgpoo7,t3_hclfeg,"Helpful info, thanks",t3_hclfeg
3050,fvus2kv,t3_hclfeg," Is there another use case other than when you are out of the house?

Do you get responses from your nearby devices when you say Alexa?  I don't wear my Echo Buds around the house much because of this.

I'm really looking for a use case because I want to buy these to look like Peter Parker in ""Spiderman:Far From Home"" (Don't judge please)",t3_hclfeg
3051,fvfsh2s,t1_fvfngzd,"So first question, they just communicate via sound, right? This isn't like another Google Glass thing where they have a tiny display? I guess the next question is can you listen to music on them and how does it sound? Is it loud enough other people can hear it?",t3_hclfeg
3052,fvfuybx,t1_fvfurn1,"Depends on volume of course, but at a comfortable volume (about 50%), it seems to be inaudible to others at about 6 feet / 2 meters.",t3_hclfeg
3053,fvfz1t0,t1_fvfyhab,"Yes I did. They happen to use the same size lenses as my normal glasses, so I just popped them in.

I plan to run to get lenses made so I can still use my regular glasses while the Alexa ones charge though. There‚Äôs an adjustment and lens guide for optometrists included in the box.",t3_hclfeg
3054,fvghgms,t1_fvgfzyx,"Yeah, basically they‚Äôre like Bluetooth earphones crammed into glasses that support Alexa. They do require a phone tethered via Bluetooth to reach the internet to use the Alexa features.

There‚Äôs not really much delay between saying the wake word and giving the command, though there‚Äôs a slight processing delay on executing some commands (like requesting a SiriusXM station or IFTTT trigger), but not much more than my echoes or dots at home. I haven‚Äôt used the car version since I had planned to get the glasses once they were released.

Today‚Äôs my first day using them. I‚Äôm at 4.5 hours of off and on use today and 40% battery, so I‚Äôll estimate 6 to 8 hours of battery life.",t3_hclfeg
3055,fvusq5u,t1_fvus2kv,"I‚Äôve used them in and out of the house, plus while out and about. Saying Alexa in the house does sometimes trigger the units in the house, unless I speak quietly or move away from the home ones. I‚Äôve had to mute nearby devices on occasion to stop them from respond to commands Im trying to give to the frames.

No worries man, I think they‚Äôd certainly do well for that sort of cosplay! They do come with fake lenses if you don‚Äôt normally wear glasses :)",t3_hclfeg
3056,fvft21h,t1_fvfsh2s,"It‚Äôs sound only, so no heads up display aside from the LED above the right lens that tells you when Alexa hears you say your wake word. I‚Äôve listened to a couple songs on it so far, and they sound pretty good for the size of the speakers. Not quite as good as in ear or over the ear headphones of course. The volume is controllable with the buttons under the right ear piece and the microphone can be muted as well. The technician working with me today says he can only hear it when it‚Äôs on max when standing a reasonable distance away.

Edit: I should also mention that they pretty much act as a Bluetooth headset for your phone.",t3_hclfeg
3057,fvg3ist,t1_fvfz1t0,That‚Äôs awesome.,t3_hclfeg

3064,fvg0wm7,t1_fvg0qgw,It worked on mine. That light would drive me crazy and I couldn't sleep.,t3_hch6kc
3065,fvg12zm,t1_fvg0wm7,Thank you for your help lol.,t3_hch6kc
3066,fvf0t3v,t3_hcgdcv,A ton of people have been getting this bug. Hopefully this is fixed with an update soon.,t3_hcgdcv

I just bought my first gen 3 Dot last week and while the audio of Alexa talking is definitely higher quality, it's EQ'd for so much bass that it rattles the glass shelf it's on and can be very difficult to understand.

It does not appear that Samsung is devoting sufficient skilled personnel and money to this project. It is starting to worry me that the V3 Hub and the new ST app have been put out there as window dressing to draw a potential new suitor but that no other co. is as yet seriously interested in acquiring SmartThings, as Samsung is simply treading water.SmartThings seems trapped between constant enhancements in Alexa, Google and wifi apps on one flank, and fully local controlled systems like Hubitat, Home Assistant et al. on the other.

However, be aware the the source of the music has to be Alexa (i.e. Amazon Music or other paired service - I used Apple Music). And the devices must either use their own speaker or be hardwired. You can't source from Bluetooth nor can a device be attached to Bluetooth speakers.

I have a large personal library (stored on a NAS) and also use Tidal and Apple Music. I also have either powered speakers or stereos in all my locations as I'm not a fan of the Alexa sound. I ended up swapping out Raspberry Pi's running Roon endpoints for the Echo devices for music and leave the Echo to control my home automation.

If he's currently using an infrared remote control to change TV channels, the Cube should also be able to emulate those infrared signals to change TV channels. After all, isn't it using infrared to turn the TV on? So it should also be able to use the same infrared to operate the channels on the TV or cable box?

Is it possibly just a matter of needing to add the cable box into the Fire TV Cube's configuration, and then it can change the channels?

It seems like as far as changing channels in the UK goes, the Fire TV Cube can only do that with Sky, and it says it will eventually support channels picked up by aerial. It seems like if you *only* have a TV, all the Fire TV Cube can do is control power, volume, and input. (Unless you have a ""Fire TV Enabled TV""...?)

Are you saying that you only watch things by using the smart TV apps, like you'll load the Netflix app or the BBC iPlayer app? Or is there somehow a way to press up and down on a remote to flip through regular channels? If so, where are those channels coming through from? I don't know much about UK TV. Just trying to get the entire picture here, I guess! Feel free to ignore me.

Worst case scenario, it does *seem like* the Harmony Hub should be able to control anything that an infrared remote can (don't quote me on that). You can even program it to understand devices it's never heard of, as long as you're able to point a remote at it, press some buttons, and tell it what those commands mean. I don't know why the Fire TV Cube would limit itself so much, since it has the ability to output infrared signals.",t3_haq8sb

Make sure is plugged and Hold Actions button for 20 seconds. Wait for voice feedback ""Resetting your device"" then release the button. Reset then Boot-up that usually takes about 3 mins. If you see the teal light circling, wait for 30 mins. If your device wont proceed to setup mode (orange light) try next step.

If that didnt work, try muting device (mute button should be red) while on boot-up/software installation then wait for 15-30 minutes.

Your device may have a pending software update trying to install. Time may vary for installation depending on how big the update is. The worst part is your device may brick if you turn off abruptly while it is installing the update so do not unplug while you see the teal light for about 30 mins.

If all fails, contact Tech support. If your device is still on warranty they will have an option to either do Warranty fix or warranty replacement.",t3_h8k6v5

If that works, but you still want the non-spammed ones still, you could then try saying ""Alexa, tell me when there's a severe weather alert"", just to see if turning it off and back on again fixes the problem.

If it won't let you delete the notifications by voice, you may have to fire up the Alexa app (not the site) and go to Settings > Notifications and delete the custom weather notifications at the bottom manually (and then try adding them again by voice if you're interested).

Last but not least, if you do delete and re-add the notification, and the bug persists, but you reaaaally want severe weather alerts, I guess you could try deleting it again, then going into your device settings and adjusting your location to a slightly different nearby location and then asking for alerts again?

I‚Äôm in the US and my uncle lives in Canada and I tried to add him to my Family Vault and found out you have to be in the same country. So pick family members that live in the same country as you. The great thing about Family Vault is they can add as many pictures as they want to. If they also have an Echo Show they will see the pictures in the Vault as well. They just have to choose the Vault as their picture background. They do not have to have Prime in order to sign up for Family Vault. You would be essentially sharing your unlimited storage with them.,t3_h0tgmt

3748,ftfgzz6,t1_ftfcedw,"Probably something like ‚ÄúAlexa read my notification‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my notification‚Äù.  Definitely something sensible.

We seem to always get just the info about the notification, but not the actual notification body.

3749,ftfiv8p,t1_ftffuu1,"We are definitely not the problem. There is no ‚ÄúFM‚Äù. And aren‚Äôt these devices supposed to understand natural language? We‚Äôre not trying to confuse it ‚Äî just want to get the notification and clear the annoying yellow ring.

And actually there is no single ""magic phrase"" as I frequently vary the wording of the question but always get the notification(s) read back to me. Judging by the comments from several others here, it seems I am not alone in having that success.  
In most cases, asking Alexa is much better than consulting a manual; and obviously, while I know that there is no manual,  that was intended as an analogy to the much simpler alternative we have to today, as Google or DuckDuckGo connect us almost instantly to solutions to our questions no matter how clumsily we phrase them.  
Lastly, if you are expecting devices which perfectly understand every single human being's individual concept of ""natural language"" maybe you have arrived much too early at the party for this bleeding edge technology. If you are in for the ride, why not try not to be so grumpy?",t3_gzbnou
3752,ftfceu4,t3_gz9yks,"If you'd be willing to use a different app there is probably a more efficient way.  Like if this Smart Plug also connects to Ifttt you can make a widget.  My help is gonna be iOS only as I don't know how Android handles Ifttt widgets.

BUT, if you are iOS you can create an Ifttt button trigger which then can be toggled through the quick menu that pops up through a long press or you can have it as a button in a widget in the widget menu when you swipe right on the home or lock screen.

Yesterday, one of the dots I use as over qualified alarm clocks disconnected itself from the wifi then I got a notification that I had a new dot to setup. After doing so the app then told me I had 5 not 4 dots and it wouldn't take voice command but kept playing the local Portuguese  radio station at what sounded like volume 7 on TuneIn.

I'd go for a bigger tablet if I did it over and maybe something a little more powerful. You have to do a couple things to make Fire devices act more like normal Android. If I did it again I think I'd go for something more standard. 

The Fire 7 would be good for a satellite controller, like maybe Master Bedroom. The Fire does have the added benefit of being another Alexa device but we use ""Echo"" as our wake word and Fire devices only support ""Alexa"" or ""Amazon"" so it doesn't help us much.

I used command strips to mount it. Clean and easy. The frames are nice too, but unless I am going to flush mount it, I think the command strip install looks fine.

Overall I'm satisfied and it is hard to beat the sale price on a Fire 7.so it probably comes down to how much you want to sink into it.",t3_gyg0bi

The command is ""remember that"", though how well it works depends on the complexity of what you say. You can also say ""Alexa, make a note"", and then follow the prompts.

When you ask the question later on, be sure to use as many of the same words as in your original command (so eg. if you say ""I put my glasses in the kitchen"", it's better to ask ""where did I put my glasses"" rather than ""where are my glasses""). It just makes the note retrieval easier.

Try it - set up a scheduled routine for your alarm time, with an action to play a track from Spotify, and as is good practice, preface that action with a volume action.

Create a second, voice activated routine called ‚Äúdismiss‚Äù actioned by that phrase, that has the following actions: device settings/stop all audio, set volume, tell today‚Äôs date, tell current time, report weather, play news from your flash briefing etc, set to respond to your chosen device.

The routine says to set the colour to, e.g, Cyan but it's actually changing it to sea green. (you can see the real colour in the device settings in the Alexa app). 
Similarly, using a routine to change to red, actually changes it to light Cyan. 

Using the device controls directly in the app works fine, it's like it's something specific to routines.

The echo is my office across the hall will often here the same command, and tell me it can't find lights because I don't have a smart switch assigned to that room.  The two echo's have no idea the other exists, so they can't negotiate to figure out which is closest to the speaker and therefore which one should actually respond.

4304,fsb33jc,t3_gt4zwg,"I see that this is 13h old and you seem to have your answer. But it doesn‚Äôt just have to be bulbs, my smart TV is in a group.  When it‚Äôs time to go to bed I just say, ‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the family room‚Äù and everything goes off pretty reliably.",t3_gt4zwg
4305,fs9fr49,t3_gt4zwg,"Nope, sorry

Why not use the group name in the first command?  For example, my living room group (named Living Room) has two smart switches, a smart plug, and a hue bulb.

When I want to turn all those on or off with a single command I just say, 

‚ÄúAlexa, turn off the living room.‚Äù  (Or turn on...)

It‚Äôs difficult for Alexa to know your smart plugs are plugged into lights, they could be other devices such as a box fan, or a noise machine, etc.

If you‚Äôre bent on using the word lights in there you could always create the exact phrase you want and use a routine to accomplish what you want but really, just say turn on or off group name, I think it‚Äôs really intuitive.  Alexa turn on the bedroom, basement, stairs, etc.",t3_gt4zwg

I just use SmartThings virtual sensors to create one trigger that in turn is the trigger for a routine.  Then I create a routine per echo device that normalizes the volume each day at 12pm and 12am.

The other quick voice based solution is to have a multi-audio group that includes every eco and just say, ""Alexa, set the everything group volume to \_\_\_\_""  But that's a large brush stroke if you want individual echos to be varying volumes (which I do, my kid's nursery echo needs to be much quieter).

4439,fs2vbid,t1_frz85c1,"thanks so much for the response.

I will elaborate a bit more. This specific example is because we are having a nanny move in with us and she will have her own Amazon / Alexa account as part of our household. from what I understand, I will have to go through the process to add the skills, groups, and routines to her phone (they don't transfer as part of the household). so here is my situation: 

1. My husband and I use the same alexa log-in and have different profiles. we see the same routines and groups. 
2. I set up a new nanny as a member of my Amazon household. When she uses her account to log in to the Alexa app, I only see Alexa devices. I was surprised - I thought as part of the household, she would see all the same groups and routines.  The routines that my husband and I see are not there. I talked to Amazon and they said that I have to add the skills for our smart lights and set up all the groups, routines etc all over again on her phone.
3. I have a ""good night"" routine that turns off downstairs lights. this is set up under my account and my husband and I use it every night.
4. I can set up a second ""good night"" routine on her phone, under her Alexa account, and have it turn off her area of the home upstairs
5. how would this work? would it know her voice and know the ""good night"" routine was for her room? IF Alexa can recognize a voice and know which good night routine to run, what if a guest whose voice is not recognized says ""alexa good night""

I guess I can wait until she moves to our home in a couple of weeks and figure it out by trial and error, but this is a huge transition for us to have someone new moving into our home - lots of moving parts - and I want to make the transition smooth by figuring out this small stuff ahead of time.",t3_grjtic
4440,fs2vfy2,t1_fs25gb3,"Thanks for the recommendation! I will check out infabric! also I elaborated in my response above - it's not necessarily for the kids.

4443,frz2628,t3_grj1gm,"Some background:
I have an amazon echo in my living room. For some reason, it shows up when I am trying to select speaker phone on my iPhone. This happens on both my iPhone 11 and work iPhone 7.

- neither phone is paired via Bluetooth to the Alexa, nor have they ever been
- amazon rep had me restart the phone, and factory reset the Alexa
- also had me verify neither phone was ever paired with the Alexa.
- I have multiple alexas in the household, and this is the only one that shows up.
- happens even when not connect to home WiFi/ even when I‚Äôm not home.
