2,alexa,ih8eq0,t3_ih8eq0,what alexa features could be in use for this ghost prank?,"please note i am not a believer in ghosts and if i was i dont think theyd be able to communicate by alexa. thats why im pretty certain theres some trickery here.

basically, i believe someone i know is being pranked through an alexa to think her dorm is haunted. their alexa is connected to one of the roommates, but as far as we know, none of the others (a total of four.) 

the alexa was acting odd already-playing music without any commands or apparent stimulation, randomly saying stuff. then, after playing a ghost app twice and discerning the ghost name as ""robert,"" on the same day the alexa randomly said M (owner of alexa) says: Robert

after that they held a like... q&a with it where they wrote questions on a paper, crumpled it up, and the alexa answered in coherent one word responses in order of what they wrote. as far as i know, these did not include the ""M says..."" preface; it was just saying the words. no notification sound either. im wondering if any of you know what feature of the alexa could be used for this prank to comfort my friend and explain why shes likely being pranked by M and not actually experiencing a ghost. i dont think itd be anything too complex feature wise bc i did find a video where you can code it to say anything but i really dont think any of them would be able to do that, and its likely phone controlled. any ideas?",1,0.67,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/ih8eq0/what_alexa_features_could_be_in_use_for_this/,tinyheartbag,1598478985.0

62,alexa,ie0m98,t3_ie0m98,Mymedia for Alexa does not work with Echo 8 when used with a default Sonos speaker,"
Please find here under the description of the issue I have with the incorrect behavior of the app Mymedia for Alexa used in an Amazon Echo 8 configured with a default Sonos system:
Description here under is based on an Echo 8 with my Sonos Port but is also valid with any of my Sonos equipments ( I have a PLAYBAR + bass + 2 Sonos 1, a Sonos 5, and a Sonos 3)

First of all a quick sum up of my configuration:
I use the last version of mymedia inside a docker of my Synology NAS
The version is currently 1.3.133.0
All my music is also in the NAS and except a very few exceptions uses the m4a format
I have a Amazon echo 8 configured to use a SONOS PORT as the default speaker system. 
I also have a Amazon Firestick 4 K configured to use the HDMI in pasthrough toward the TV set linked to a SONOS PLAYBAR via optical.

Both systems Echo/Port and Firestick/TV/PLAYBAR don’t work 
“Don’t work” means that when I ask to play an album, I have the first track only of the album, the picture of the album only a few seconds on the screen then picture goes away . 
Please note that even long time after I can say “Alexa suivant” ( means Next) and it plays the next ones. So it seems some process is hung.

On the contrary when I use Alexa with the IPhone ( alone), IPad (alone) or the embedded Alexa of my OLED LG TV ( linked through optical cable to the SONOS PLAYBAR, it works
“It works” means that I have the picture of the album during all the time and system changes itself track to next tracks as it should work.
Please note that some times it plays 2 times the same first track of the album then stops.

I have a contact with the develop team of mymedia for Alexa and their analysis thanks to traces I sent them is that this issue is on the Sonos side that obviously requests inconsistent to play several times the same track.
I cannot understand all their explanations but they asked me that they should be very happy to enter in contact with your team for fixing that issue .
Finally please not that Mymedia for Alexa is a very interesting program to use with Alexa as in France Amazon does not provide neither the Plex support or the Audio station skill

scenario 1:  Often (like many times a day), I start a tv program, it plays fine for a short while, then the video freezes but the sound continues to play (ha! happened again as I type this right now for the 5th time this evening.)  I have to back out to the menu, then select to resume the program again.

scenario 2:  Often (many times a day), I start a tv program, it plays fine for a short while, then the video freezes for a second but the sound continues to play - then the video takes off at about 2x the speed and the audio continues to play at normal speed.   Sometimes it goes on for five minutes before I notice if I'm reading Reddit :).   If I press pause, the video pauses, but the sound continues to play for several minutes until it catches up to the point that the video paused.

97,alexa,ic0266,t3_ic0266,Looking for feedback on my dissertation,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I am a Portuguese university student, currently working on my Master's thesis dissertation. As part of my dissertation, I had to create a natural language interaction for an existing autonomous agent framework, and I used the Alexa Skills Kit to do that.

&#x200B;

For the past months I have worked on and developed this skill that allows you to communicate with the Virtual Suspect agent framework, which is an autonomous agent that inhabits the role of a suspect in the context of a police interrogation. Now I am looking for people to test the skill, so I can get some feedback and finish my dissertation. If this sounds interesting to you, or you would just like to help me out, here's what I need you to do:

&#x200B;

1) Before you open the skill, please read this document containing information about the case that you need to know in order to interrogate the Virtual Suspect, as well as some guidelines on how to interact with him: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU\_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

2) Enable the Virtual Suspect Demo skill, which can be found at: [https://www.amazon.com/IST\_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/](https://www.amazon.com/IST_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/)

2a) You can open the skill by saying ""Alexa open Virtual Suspect"" and then you'll be placed in a dialogue with the agent and you can ask him questions about the case directly. There is no endpoint, you can ask him whatever questions you want and finish whenever you want, the session will be maintained until you decide to end the interaction.

&#x200B;

3) After you finish your conversation with Peter, please answer this questionnaire about your experience, it should take no more than 5 minutes to fill and no personal information is recorded: [https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8](https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8)

&#x200B;

If you do decide to try out my skill, please bear in mind that this is merely a prototype created for academic purposes and is not intended to be a fully realized game.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask!

You don't even need to leave a 5-star review or anything like that, just trying out my skill and answering the questionnaire will help me a lot!

&#x200B;

I have Alexa, google home and smartthings hub at  home, but recently start using Iphone Xs.  Installed the Meross MSG100  garage opener last night and it works well with Alexa and its own native  app (for sending notification of garage status).

What  I want to achieve is to geofencing the garage opener, but need it to be  smaller than the minimum 492ft Alexa has for geofencing.  I have a long  driveway leading to a garage in the back, so ideally I should be able  to use ""phone connected to home wifi"" as a trigger to at least open the  garage.  Only thing I don't want it to happen is while I'm out walking  with my phone, the garage opens and closes when I'm connecting to home  wifi (i have set up mesh wifi, so the coverage of my wifi is pretty  big).  At mininum, I'd like to be able to use Siri to open/close the  garage (in IOS, it looks like I have to open the alexa app in order to  voice control, so that's an extra step)

I've  read some posts about geofencing using IFTTT or SimpleCommand with  Alexa.  Not sure if there are applets/scripts out there that I can  simply use.

Similar to walking into a coffee shop and hearing soft music coming from everywhere.

Our game room is quite large, and I'd prefer to have 3-4 small speakers sitting around on bookshelves or counters.  We have an Echo Dot that we use for lights, or A/C, and a couple other things.  We'd like to use it to play music on these 3-4 speakers (one of them can be the Echo Dot).  I guess I could just buy 3 of the Echo Dots and sync them, but is that the best way?  

We don't care about sound quality... not really, anyway.  The Echo Flex is too tinny (we need a little bass).  Volume never goes above about 20% on any device.  We like the convenience of talking to Alexa for music... we do that all the time and prefer it to any other method of finding music.

I am able to launch the Alexa app on the TV and log in just fine.  I've also created and logged into LG ThinQ app and can control the TV when it is powered on through the app.

However, I am unable to control the TV through Alexa despite the advertising of this TV as Alexa compatible and not sure what the problem is.

However, I am unable to control the TV through my echo dot even though the device is listed.

Everything is on the same WIFI network also.

I then tried adding the LG ThinQ basic skill, and after logging into my LG account, the skill says my account is linked but when it searches for devices, my TV is not showing up to add.  I suspect this is because it was already added through the Alexa app on the TV?

Has anyone else encountered this issue and know of a reliable solution?  I've tried de-registering the TV and just adding the skill, not logging into the TV's Alexa app and no luck as well.

The dots sounds terrible when using one, but surprisingly good when paired in stereo.

The echoes are OK when using one, still better when paired in stereo.

Had one studio to begin with that sounded incredible on its own. Added a second studio to pair in stereo and it’s not as amazing as I had hoped. Although the sound is separated by channel, each one sounds about 50% weaker so the total volume output is still the same as I would get from a single studio.

Then, there’s the fire TV. When that is playing music by itself, the volume and sound from my TV sound bar is great.

I like to have music playing throughout the house, so I started adding my speakers to multi room groups. Whenever I play on a group, the volume and quality of sound coming through the fire TV/sound bar is horrendously bad. It is in the same group as the studios, which sound the same as when they are paired as stereo.

I also have a single dot pushing sound out through an aux cable/external speaker. If I’m just playing music to that, it sounds fine. As soon as I add it to a group, the sound quality is garbage.

Does Alexa not broadcast the full throughput of of audio signal to every device in a multi room group? Is it splitting left and right channels? Is the problem that I should not be mixing stereo pairs and single speakers in the same group?

Tried to get her to open “Sleep Sounds” (another skill) and same thing. Asked her for the weather and that was fine, she gave me that. Asked her to do another white noise skill (Ocean Sounds) and she did that.  Asked for the Ambient Noise skill again and same thing. The next night I tried again  and all was well, so I thought it was a glitch, but it’s doing the same thing today. 

Does anybody know why this is happening or how to fix it?

Ring stick up cam
Ring alarm hub

Alexa can control all the above, but the scheduling is a little weird.  Here's what I'm trying to do:

1. This works already: 15 minutes before sunrise, turn on outside lights. Then at 1015, turn off the outside lights.
2. This is where it's a little tricky... From 1015 to sunrise, I want the lights to turn on if motion is detected and back off 15 minutes later.  It seems I can't schedule a window of time to sunrise for something like this.  So I thought maybe just set the end time to 7am, then set another routine to turn the lights off at sunrise.  But then if motion is detected after sunrise the lights turn back on and don't turn off.

Like Jean-Luc, many of us have several toilet fans and ceiling fans throughout our house. We'd love to say ""Turn on Fan"" and have Alexa recognize the device / room / group and be smart enough.  In Jean-Luc's case, his device was called ""L43 S21CC Toilet Fan"".  You can't actually expect the good captain to remember that, can you??  Well, the point is that he shouldn't have to.

Currently, Alexa groups only keep two aliases: ""Lights"" and ""Speakers"".  That's simply not enough.  Alexa engineers could go about enabling better device recognition one of two ways:

1) Allow user-defined aliases.  For example, let Jean-Luc add ""Fan"" as an alias to his group, and then add ""L43 S21 CC Toilet Fan"" device to that alias. Done. Now he just needs to say ""Turn on Fan"" or ""Turn on Fans"".

2) Allow for group / device character recognition.  For example, suppose his group was called ""L43 S21 CC"".  Okay, so clearly when he said ""Toilet Fan"" perhaps Alexa would first look within the group for ""... Toilet Fan""!

Or really, both approaches would be nice, and are essentially compatible with each other.  Further, we should be able to address devices by Alias-""in""-Room.

263,alexa,i2apkk,t3_i2apkk,Looking for beta testers for a new home inventory management system (Skill & App)," My name is Yonatan, and I am a 30-year-old entrepreneur. Over the past three months, I have worked extensively to develop an Alexa Skill that helps households to save money and manage their home inventory through a unique voice interface.

The system allows you to:

* Save more time with an auto-generated grocery list that is sent to your email when it's time restock.
* Save money by using relevant coupons and discounts based on your real consumption.
* Be notified when items are running out or about to expire, and stop wasting food.

All this good can be controlled from your Alexa app when you're out, or at home using simple voice commands such as:

""Alexa, how many Bananas do I have in my kitchen?""

""Alexa, how much milk is left in my kitchen?""

We are currently in the final development phase of private Beta and will be happy to have as many testers as possible to optimize the product before its official launch.

If you want to become a Beta tester, feel free to private message me or simply fill out this form: [https://mailchi.mp/a43fbacb6174/ekitchen-beta-version](https://mailchi.mp/a43fbacb6174/ekitchen-beta-version)

I’d like to set these up in each of my kids’ room (11 and 7), with the idea that I’d like them to be able to ask Alexa to set an alarm, control some smart plugs in their rooms, access our Apple Music subscription, and for me to announce stuff to them (both individually and together).

I don’t have an Alexa device myself, just the app on my iPhone which I would use to set up the Dots, and use to drop in/send announcements.  Here are my questions:

My kids each have their own iPads (not phones).  Does it make sense for me to set everything up from my phone or should I set up each from the Alexa app on each of their iPads?

I’d like to be able to control each kid from dropping in on each other (likewise, I don’t feel the need to “drop in” on my kids, but I still would like to “intercom” back and forth if possible).  My main concern being my older kid being an ass and announcing at all hours and waking up my younger one.  I’d also like to limit each kid from triggering scenes or turning smart devices on and off in each others’ rooms...

Am I going about this correctly?  Should I be doing different accounts/linking inside a household/having the Alexa app on each kid’s iPad?

I go in, delete these new stations from Pandora's collection, but it Alexa keeps adding them back.

My oldest son is named Alexander (born long before Alexa was released) and everybody calls him Alex, as everybody can guess, calling him triggers all Alexas within earshot. So we change the wake word. I didn’t especially fancy talking to ‘Amazon’ so we changed it to ‘Echo’ (there are also too many ‘Computer’s at home to avoid that wake word).

Now my first surprise was when I got my Echo Auto and had to find out that I cannot change the wake word at all! The device is great IMO but guess what, I am still driving with my son in the car and talk to him (or about him with my wife).

Just now I got a Fire Tablet 7 and of course the first thing I wanted to do was change the wake word. You can but the only choices are ‘Alexa’ and ‘Amazon’...

Why oh why!?!? This can bring a grown man close to tears. </rant>

386,alexa,hvo5g7,t3_hvo5g7,Receiving messages on an Echo Show (for person on their 90s),"Hi,

We’ve long been looking for a way to be able to send quick messages to my mother-in-law. She is absolutely no interest in computers & doesn’t have SMS/texting on her cell phone. 

I’ve wondered about a smart assistant device w/ display. We mostly use Google/Nest in our place but I’m also considering the Echo Show. The assisted living facility where she resides has a captive portal free WiFI & they have several of these around for the residents, so I’m sure it’s compatible with their internet.

I have a few questions about the Echo Show that I cannot answer since I don’t yet use it myself:  
  
Is there a way that we could send her messages to the Echo Show and have them show up on screen or at least tell her that they are available so she could ask about it? She does NOT have a smartphone but we both have iOS/Android devices so we could use the Alexa app to send messages. Does she have to have a smartphone to receive messages on the Echo Show?  
  
What would I need to do to set things up so that we could do calling, video calling, and messages via text (I don’t need it to be SMS, just a short message on screen using whatever protocol).   
  
Would she also have access to any music on this without paying extra? Our household has Prime but she does not. She wouldn’t want any popular music but might like some older stuff, hymns, etc. Is there a child sharing option for the free Prime Music or video?
  
Is there a way we could share photos to her Echo Show?  
  
Is there anything else that can be done on the Echo Show without paying a monthly fee or could we attach her to our Prime in some way? I’m wondering about audiobooks, podcasts, video, news, etc. She has no TV or newspaper and isn’t online so this might provide some interesting connection for her.  
  
Are there any “safety” features that could be enabled - for instance, if she ever fell in her studio apartment, she could call the Echo for help? I seem to remember this being an option without additional fees.
  
Are there any added features that do cost extra and might be worth paying for? If she can’t afford it, perhaps we could take care of that.
  
What is needed to setup/configure her Echo Show? Can I do it without having one myself? I could maybe get it sent to me first, I guess or are there other options?

401,alexa,husgpz,t3_husgpz,I sold a Smarthome item and Alexa keeps giving me notifications for it.,"Oof I think I’ve gotten myself into a pickle and I can’t seem to ‘undo’ it. 


A few weeks ago I sold a Philips Hue Hub. I have used Hue at my old house and at my new home, and from being gifted many sets I had a few extra Hubs (bridges). I sold it as ‘used’ though wasn’t really sure if I’d ever plugged it in. 


I currently have my Hue set up and normally use Alexa as my Smart Home Assistant. 

Yesterday I was away from home and received notifications from Alexa; “New Hue Device ... Hue White Candle” followed by 10 similar notifications for items I didn’t own. 

I checked my Hue app and these ‘new’ items don’t show up in there, but they did appear in my Alexa app. It seems the old Hue Hub is somehow connected to my Alexa account? My Hue app also only shows one Hub, the one I’m currently using. 

I’m not sure what I need to do, I’ve tried everything but I can’t actually seem to ‘disconnect the old Hue Hub from Alexa and I’m not sure why. Neither Hub (my current or old) are listed in the ‘devices’ on Alexa. 

Everything on the Alexa website says I should be able to delete or disable a Hub from the “devices” screen but ... it’s just not there.

I can delete the individual candles but when I ‘discover’ it just rediscovers them.

I have a standing 7 AM alarm set every day but sometimes I want to cancel that alarm and set a new one for earlier or later. I will say, ""Alexa cancel my 7 AM alarm,"" and she will reply ""your next 7 AM alarm is canceled. Would you like to cancel this alarm for every weekday?""

My issue is I'm tired of her asking me if I want to cancel it every day and having to respond ""no"" every time I change the alarm. I just want to change the alarm that one time and move on lol. I have tried the following voice commands and none of them seem to work:

1) Alexa, cancel my next 7 AM alarm 
2) Alexa, cancel today's 7 AM alarm only
3) Alexa, only cancel my 7 AM alarm for today 
Etc... You get the picture.

until a month ago I could listen to a podcast on my smartphone and then continue it on my Alexa by just saying ""alexa, spiel spotify"" (alexa, play spotify as I am located in germany).

Now, whenever I try it, Alexa doesn't continue the podcast that I was listening to on my smartphone. Instead it plays random music I was listening to before. So I have to search the podcast on the Spotify app, select it again and search for the right part, which is annoying.

483,alexa,hqbf8p,t3_hqbf8p,Trouble with Alexa Routine,"Hello,

I'm trying to setup a Routine to do the following:

-Set volume to 2

-Play Sleep Sounds

-Wait 1 minute

-Set volume to 1

-Set timer for 29

-Stop audio

1) The 2nd action, ""Play Sleep Sounds"" doesn't work because I'm told that any Skill-based action must be placed at the very end of the Routine. Obviously, this won't work because if I place Play Sleep Sounds as the last step, I won't be able to set my Echo to automatically stop after 30 minutes (1 min initial at volume 2 and the remaining 29 minutes on volume 1).

I set them up with some echos throughout their house, which they've quite enjoyed for music, alarms etc.  I set it up on my account, even though it's at their house.  I don't live near my folks, unfortunately, and to go over to there house would require a whole weekend trip.


Recently, they had a new ISP, and as a result switched their modem/router, which resulted in their echos no longer functioning.  

Is there any sort of way that I can remedy this and get their devices configured to their new wifi?  Or would it be easier to walk my dad through getting the Alexa app on his phone and then getting him to set up the device himself? 

I'd strongly prefer an option that didn't require my dad fiddle with his phone, which is already frustrating for him.

486,alexa,hq03jm,t3_hq03jm,Make Alexa audio come from ceiling speakers,"Hi y’all, is there a known solution for making Alexa enabled devices come out of my wired ceiling speakers?

So we’re constructing a new home atm and are requesting for for ceiling speakers to be installed at various locations throughout the house. I think it’d be awesome for the house to be a smart house and have Alexa devices like echo dots/echo show throughout the various rooms the when spoken to, will have the audio come from the ceiling speakers.

My question is if there are any suggestions to making the response audio come from those speakers? The speakers are klipsch speakers and I plan on having the wires terminate to my network closet the houses my modem/switch/router/amps/receivers etc. 

I’d also like for the different speakers to be confined to the group/room that they’ll live where I want certain commands to come from. (I.e. I’m in the living room and be able to say “Alexa play music in kitchen” and only the kitchen ceiling speakers will play or “Alex play music everywhere” and speakers in all rooms to play. 

I’ve seen the Echo link amp and this seems like something I could get to power my speakers but I fully don’t understand how this would work with the dots/show. Also, the amp can only power 1 pair of speakers and I’d like to have at least 3 different groups of speakers.

523,alexa,ho7qm8,t3_ho7qm8,Issue with some smart devices - Alexa says device is not responding,"I have some smart light switches installed in my house.  Specifically the TP-Link Kasa HS200/HS220.  They seem to work great on their own.  Once they were installed, I downloaded the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  I registered them with the Kasa app and have never had a problem with turning them on/off no matter where I am in the world.

The problem is with integration to Alexa.  I go into Alexa, register the TP-Link Kasa skill, discover the devices, and everything works great!  Or, it has worked great up until about a week ago.  Now, Alexa is constantly saying that ""Living room lights is not responding"", ""Dining room lights is not responding"".  This seems to happen randomly for different Kasa switches.  The only way to get them to respond to Alexa commands is to remove and re add them.  Once I re add the ""broken"" ones, after a little bit a few more stop working with Alexa and I need to re add them again.  Which is a pain and totally defeats the purpose of having purchased them anyway, considering 90% of my reason for buying smart switches was to control them with voice commands.

I don't think the problem is with my home network, because the switches ALWAYS respond when sending commands from within the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  Whether I am at my house, or out in the world, or on a WiFi network, the Kasa app never fails.  But the link between the Kasa switches and Amazon Alexa seems to be totally unreliable.  For weeks after I installed them, everything was working great.  But as of a couple weeks ago, it's just a mess.

Again, the TP-Link switches always work perfectly when controlled through the Kasa app on my phone, whether I am at home or not.  I also have other non TP-Link smart devices (sockets, bulbs, the Echo units themselves, etc.) which all work perfectly.  When I run a tcpdump from my router, I can see that for the ""broken"" devices, a signal never comes from the Internet to control the smart switch, whereas it does for the other devices that are currently working, some of which are other Kasa devices controlled through the same Alexa skill.

I have tried the following without arriving at a permanent fix:

\-Assigning static DHCP leases to all my devices (just in case)

\-Removing and re adding all of the TP-Link smart switches from Alexa

\-Removing and re adding the TP-Link Kasa Alexa skill

\-Restarting the smart devices

\-Restarting my wireless router

None of these fixes have made any difference.  And, of course, why would they when the problem seems to be related to the Skill link in the cloud between Alexa and TP-Link Kasa.

Hey Guys, thanks a lot to anyone that reads this and offers their opinion 😊  
 

I’m trying to make a decision here and I’m hoping you can help. I want a wireless setup because we like the minimal look in our living room and can’t decide between these packages from Sonos and Amazon.  
 

SONOS  
 2 x Sonos ONES  
 1 x Sonos Beam  
 1 x Sonos Sub = $1900AUD  
 

AMAZON  
 2 x Amazon Echo 3rd Gen  
 1 x Amazon Echo Sub. = $600AUD  
 

I’m aware the Sonos setup will sound better, but how much ‘better’? Is the Beam package worth the extra $1300?  
 

I was just going to plug the TV into the amazon echo via 3.5mm.  
 I want to listen to music and watch HD sports/movies. I like that the Sonos can be mounted on stands. We like alexa and heard the Sonos ONES had poor microphones, however I’m really wondering does anyone have experience with the microphones on the BEAM? Are they better than the frowned upon mic’s in the ONE compared to Echo.  
 

I could also do a pair of Sonos 5’s for $1200 AUD or 2 x Echo Studio’s for $660.  
 

What’s the best value here? Anyone have experience with both products??

My mom passed away in December leaving my step-dad all alone in his house, two hours away from me, during this lockdown. I stay in touch with him all the time, but I’m trying to find other ways we can stay connected over shared interests. 

We both like similar movies and tv shows and I have previously set him up on my Apple family to be able to watch my purchases on iTunes. He has a fire cube hooked up to his tv with Alexa built in.

He’s in his 70s and even though we’ve gone through the steps to get to the Apple TV app and browse my library of movies and shows I think it’s still too cumbersome for him to remember and go through on his own. 

I’m curious if he could simply say “Alexa, watch Oceans Eleven on Apple TV” if it would go straight to just playing the movie from my library. 

His tv does automatically switch inputs to the fire cube when using voice activation, but once he’s at the home screen he just gets a little lost.

I tried changing names of the playlist, but it still cannot find it.

Well, that changes now. While you can't disable Guard within a Routine, you can trigger a Routine by disabling Guard... 

The default voice command for this is ""Alexa, I'm home."" I didn't know this when I created my custom 'I'm Home' routine and, as a result, my departure routine could arm Guard but my return routine was preempting the default behavior.  **The solution** was to change the trigger for my arrival from Voice>""I'm home"" to Guard>Home. Now my same trigger words (""I'm home"") will do both, set Guard to 'Home' *and* turn on my lights, adjust start devices, or whatever else is in the routine.",14,0.94,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/hhnl8p/cant_set_guard_to_home_via_routines/,NYSNDGUY,1593382285.0

&#x200B;

So this website [https://creator.voiceflow.com/](https://creator.voiceflow.com/) is by far the greatest creation known to man in terms of Alexa skill building. It allows anyone, regardless of how much knowledge of code they may or may not have, make comprehensive complex and in depth skills for Alexa.

&#x200B;

It achieves this by making a majority of the tedious (to me mind boggling) coding language a thing of the past and puts everything you need into a DIY drag and drop template profile creator (kind of like Amazon's own but EVEN better and more direct)

&#x200B;

I know absolutely NOTHING about coding (not for a lack of trying mind you) and ive created things such as this [https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467](https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467) which is the Federal News Network from Starship Troopers (Would you like to know more?)

It's a simple gag skill that plays each of the movies propaganda reels sounds one after another upon replying yes to ""Would you like to know more"", stupidly simple to some, suicidal rage inducing weeks of frustration because i cant code to others (like me) without this site.

&#x200B;

Now youre probably wondering why im sucking this sites dick so much and its simple, IT DESERVES TO BE SUCKED. As stated its run by 3 guys named Braden, Nicholas, and Andrew,  along with 16 other incredible people and all of them are not only REAL people, they interact with you on a personal 1 on 1 basis.

&#x200B;

For example, the reason im making this to begin with is because i asked them a random noob question about whether or not i could make an invocation use a random undefined word so i could make a ""Where is my ""X"" "" (x=any single word of my choosing in the moment, IE keys, book etc) and not only did Nicholas reply to me at 1:30am for whats probably the most basic noob question ever and take the time

&#x200B;

BUT HE LITERALLY RECORDED HIMSELF MAKING A STEP BY STEP VIDEO OF HOW TO DO IT SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR ME ON A WHIM [https://www.loom.com/share/ccfaa41294104fe0bf8671fa27cca99e](https://www.loom.com/share/ccfaa41294104fe0bf8671fa27cca99e)

oh, and then when HE WENT AND FUCKING TESTED IT JUST CUS HES A BALLER and found that it didnt quite work what did he do? 

&#x200B;

WENT AND MADE ANOTHER VIDEO [https://www.loom.com/share/fa2b610bba9a4255bb7d02d1923dacdd](https://www.loom.com/share/fa2b610bba9a4255bb7d02d1923dacdd)

&#x200B;

This ladies and gents is easily the greatest customer service experience i think ive ever had the pleasure to recieve in my entire life, this site is amazing, the developers are amazing, you owe it to yourself to try it if you have any interest in skill building and you most certainly owe it to them to spread the word if you like it!

- I will ask the echo to play the latest episode of WTF with Marc Maron podcast, and it will play an episode from 1 month ago. This has happened numerous times, always the same episode from a month ago, and it doesn’t actually play it.

- I will ask it to play a song, even one that I own in my amazon library, or available through apple music which I have a subscription to (and enabled as my default service in the app) and it will say it is only available through an Amazon music subscription.

- I will ask it to play a song and it will say the song then just not play it.

My hardware:

SmartThings Hub v2.0.

Various echos throughout the house.

AppleTV with Homekit enabled.

Mostly GE Z Wave switches and devices.

Also some legacy Wemo switches.

Some Philips Hue bulbs.

My goal:

To be able to use either Alexa or Siri to control devices. While I typically use Alexa, there are enough situations where it's just far more convenient to use my iPhone without opening the Alexa app.

The problem:

The Wemo and Hue hardware all shows up with 3 instances in the Alexa app. This causes it to be very unreliable. Only one of them actually works (always the one controlled by SmartThings)

My suspicion is that Alexa is scanning and finding a Wemo switch on the Wemo app (it has the Wemo skill) and on the ST hub, and maybe on the Homekit app? It doesn't have a Homekit skill. If not there, I don't know where the 3rd instance comes from.

I found one article that suggests limiting Alexa's ability to find devices on ST. My problem with that solution is twofold:

1. It presumably only eliminates one instance.
2. The ST version is the reliable working instance.

If anyone knows how to remedy this, I'd be very grateful!

703,alexa,hd2o7v,t3_hd2o7v,Echo / Audible / Spotify annoying af,"I bought a new Echo for the kitchen and decided to move the Dot to beside my bed. 
As I like listening to audiobooks/ podcasts before going to sleep, I figured the Dot would sound better than my iPhones inbuilt speaker. 

First thing I went to do was disable the mic, since I don’t really want it listening all the time. Turns out the red ring stays on permanent, no way to turn it off. Can’t have this staying on all night, not a fan of light in the room

Next thing was using Audible. Turns out I have to use the Alexa app to play them through the Dot, so once that was setup I started playing a book, however there is no option to play at 1.5x speed, nor is there the option to set a sleep timer from inside the app. 

So I thought, Spotify will work with the Dot, I must be able to set a sleep timer with that. However when I go to set the sleep time in Spotify, it says I can’t and I need to disconnect from the Dot to do this. 

The biggest reason for having a sleep time set from the app/phone is if my wife is already asleep, the last thing I want to do is start talking to Alexa and wake her up / scary the shit out of her. 

Really disappointed with the fragmentation of these smart things. Everything seems to work on their own but not together.

Ok, it is kind of strange that I can’t do this.

Has anyone figured out how to go back multiple tracks while listening to music?

You can go back to the beginning of the current track using “go back”, “skip back”, “go to previous” and what have you.

But no matter what, you seem to be able to go back to the beginning of the current song, not to any of the previous songs, which is really inadequate.

I looked up, and even this comprehensive webpage doesn’t tell you you can go back multiple tracks.

I recently received a Fire TV Cube for my birthday and love it. I already have an Amazon Echo Plus in my room that i use regularly. My question is, is there a way to sync both devices so that i do not have two separate hubs answering my questions? For instance, when i am sitting in front of my TV and i ask Alexa a question, the Fire TV Cube will respond. Likewise, when i am around other parts of my room, the Echo Plus that i have on my end table will respond. 

Is there a way to have both devices answer simultaneously? A good example i thought of this morning was when i am listening to music on my Echo Plus, i would love to have the Fire TV Cube also playing in sync so that different parts of my room are playing the same music. 

Sometimes it can be annoying when i ask Alexa something and the Fire TV Cube will pick it up instead of my Echo Plus, and vice versa.

The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day. 

I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.

The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about.  ???  Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another alexa device.... (Why would I buy another Alexa device that I'm sure will just break down as soon as it's out of its warranty period??)

This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault? 

I expect these devices to last longer than a year.... I'm very frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction. 

Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.

I have 2 dots, both have the fabric wraps, not sure what generation they are.

I have one named Left Dot, one named Right Dot. They are together in a speaker group called Office. Both are connected to the same wifi.

I changed my command word from ""Alexa"" to ""Computer"" for these two speakers.

I say ""Computer, play Spotify"". Either speaker might pick me up, it says ""this is Spotify"". 

Music only plays out of the Left dot. Only left. I can control the volume with the Right dot, just no sound. Check the Alexa app and it shows music playing on Office.

Then, within 5 minutes, the music stops. I look in the app, and it shows it's still playing on Office.

I've unplugged both many times, that seems to work for a limited time. This is so unreliable. The sound quality isn't bad when it actually does work.

1. There's a preset for coffee (*Bleagh!*), but not tea. Savages.

Upon powering it up, it will turn on (blue ring) then have the teal bar running clockwise for a while before shutting off and trying again. I've heard that the length of the bar determines how far along in the process it is? It gets to the point where it takes up two thirds of the ring and immediately shuts off. Trying to reset it will cause the blue ring of death and the only way to fix it is to unplug it. 

It won't turn orange. It won't turn red if I mute the microphone. I cant adjust the volume.

Important Notes:

* I'm using the [browser version](http://alexa.amazon.com/) of the Alexa app to manage the account, not a mobile app. I'm not sure if this matters.
* I'm located within the U.S.

The Echo is connected to WiFi and working fine. However, when I go into the Alexa account settings to select the default music station/library, Spotify [isn't even listed](https://imgur.com/wONSZUo) as an option.

From researching online, apparently most people who have this problem are located outside the U.S. The most commonly proposed solution is to go into your Amazon Account ""Your Content and Devices"" settings and change your country to the United States.

Like I mentioned, we're already in the US. To be safe, I went in and re-entered [the correct location info](https://imgur.com/plpAwqP) anyway.

After doing this, unplugging the Echo and logging in and out of the Alexa app (browser version), it's still not working. The Amazon support line is currently unavailable, so I can't get in contact with them. They have bigger fish to fry at the moment, so I understand.

I used one before as a PC speaker because it was most comfortable and the sound was okay.

What the great minds of Amazon didn't think about/what's wrong with it:

You can't use two, when being in Bluetooth mode. So you can't use it to play audio from your PC or when steaming music via Bluetooth from your phone to it. only one is working then.

It's having a huge latency when it comes to song selection via Spotify and has problems in general. Like I chose a song on Spotify via phone or computer and it takes several seconds until it starts. Then sometimes only one works when even though the 'room' is selected and not one single Alexa. 
Sometimes it takes almost a minute until it works as it should.

The best part: you stick headphones in? Well yeah the sound is now in your headphones, but the Alexa won't mute itself. So you have to select one Alexa and then stick the headphones in. But the Alexa which is the right channel, won't be shown as a selection. So if you want to use headphones and your left Alexa isn't near you, because you used always the right one for headphone stuff: well shit happens.

834,alexa,gzqy3d,t3_gzqy3d,Smart Plugs turn on when I say turn on lights,"Hi all,

I hope someone is here who can explain me what is going on with my Alexa...

I  haven´t used Alexa much for Smart Home control for the last year or so. Since I made switch to Home Assistant a few weeks back, I now wanted to use Alexa more again. So far most of the things are working well and I found my ""love"" for Alexa again 😁.

&#x200B;

There is only one strange behavior. I do have a few smart plugs that I do use to turn on several ""dumb"" devices e.g. a Pond, a Globe, ""dumb"" Lightstrip etc.

In the Alexa App I set the type for these devices to Plug (""Stecker"" in german) as I don´t want them to turn on when I say ""Turn on the lights in the Living Room"".

Alexa seems to ignore this and still turns on/off switches when I use the light phrase.

I first thought that this may be something thats related to Home Assistant skill. I then tried to connect a Belkin WeMo directly to Alexa and got the same behavior. So nothing that has to do with the skill.

Does anyone have an idea?

We have a nanny that moved in last night. We have our whole house configured to be a smart home (lights, thermostats, etc). She has her own Alexa to control her part of the house but also obviously needs to control the common areas as well when she is keeping the baby during the day. 

My husband and I share an amazon account and have two voice profiles under the account. Always worked fine.

I set her up her own amazon account as the second adult in our household and connected to Alexa because I think that’s the only way to have two Spotify accounts connected.  Also my husband and I don’t really want her to see our order history on Alexa. Nothing to hide but occasionally we might buy her surprises etc and it’s easier than trying to archive or hide orders. But now it is getting so complicated to add all the skills, devices, and set up each and every routine all over again. 🙄 
I’m wondering if the second account instead of another voice profile was the right thing to do.

(1) be able to control devices as needed
(2) link to her Spotify account

We were previously using just an Echo Dot connected via Aux cable to a better speaker, but the aux port on that speaker has started to fail. I thought it would be a good idea then to go and purchase a smart soundbar that was alexa compatible, since it seemed to me that would allow for multi-room music, so we bought a Sonos soundbar, but it doesn't seem the alexa app wants to recognize that as a speaker availabe for multiroom. 

I'm worried that just returning the Sonos and buying a different brand will not resolve the issue, and with covid and everything going on rn it's very difficult to get ahold of my local Best Buy (that's about the only electronics store we've got around me), but without an actual person to talk to about this issue I'm pretty lost on what to do and/or look for

Update:  I have found hacks to be able to get this to work using the Xbox skill.  I can put two alexas  next to each other and have one say the commands to the second.  Alternatively I can use an old android phone and tasker to play an audio recording of me giving the commands to my alexa.

Update 2: SOLVED.  I referenced another reddit thread that tipped me off that alexa can trigger another alexa.  I had numerous old echo dots and I set up a routine where an alexa will say on full volume commands for the other dot (""Alexa, tell xbox to turn on"" ""Alexa, tell xbox to open youtube"").  For anyone who might find this in the future, if you're willing to spend $15 to buy an old echo dot version on ebay or buy one when they're on sale - it's worked perfectly and I think its totally worth $15 to be able to put customized commands into alexa routines.  Xbox skill has a ""navigate"" that lets you mimic pressing buttons on the controller that I used to go left to the sidebar, down to library, down to playlists, enter into playlist, enter to play the first video in the playlist.  

Downsides: 
- It takes a minute for the dot to tell all the commands to the other dot
- I ended up using ""Watch Later"" as a specific playlist instead of watch later.  I did this because watch later is always at the same place on the app so I can guarantee the correct playlist is launched from my routine.",1,0.57,16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/gvnpox/can_you_stream_youtube_to_xbox_using_alexa/,empathy-is-trending,1591161771.0

930,alexa,gva2xm,t3_gva2xm,Skill idea? A skill that helps you remember where you put things.,"tl;dr: You tell the device where you put things, then ask and the device recalls it for you. If someone makes this they will literally be a god in my eyes.

I came up with this idea, but have no idea how to put it into action. Basically you say ""Alexa, I put my wallet on my desk"" or something like that, and then you go about your life. Then, when you forgot where you put your stuff, you ask ""Alexa, where did I put my wallet?"" and then it responds ""You put your wallet on your desk.""

I don't have much experience coding in the languages that are used to make skills, and even then only have experience coding apps, but here's how I guess it would work:

The trigger phrase would be ""Alexa, I put my \*object\* \*location\*"" or even Alexa, my \*object\* is \*location\*"" then it would remember the object and the location, and when you give the recall trigger, ""Alexa, where did I put \*object\*?"", it finds the location that correlates to the object and relies ""You put \*object\* \*location\*.""

If you say the same object twice, it automatically replaces the older of the object's location with the newer one.

*Target audience:*

I have no idea if this is actually feasible, but i it is and somebody decides to go and make it, I want to give more info on who might actually use this.

I have ADHD and I know it would be a major help to those with ADHD who forget where they put things, as well as older people who forget where they put things. Let's face it, everyone forgets where they put things and I'm sure it would be quite a useful skill.

As I was done with the free one provided by my ISP.  My internet performance as well as my stability with the new router has improved dramatically. So I wont be changing it.

I noticed the free router couldn't handle installing the amount of Lifx bulbs in my home.  I have a dozen or so connected.  So I needed a better router to handle that many devices.  However, over time I've noticed Alexa is getting increasingly dumber with her voice commands.  She frustrates me how precise I need to be when controlling my lights brightness with finishing my command with 100%, 90% etc... I use to just say raise brightness of a exact device or the room I categorized the lights in.  Now I get a response from her like ""Please try again. Only use % for brightness"" Then she gets confused on which device I'm trying to control.

Now I noticed my custom routines aren't completely changing my lights colors over to my desired setting.  They tend to get stuck on the previous color and only adjust my requested brightness within the routine.  But if I make a voice command to each device separately, they do switch to my desired color.  I can't believe I have to make meta changes to my routines just to get my lights to do what they've been capable of doing for almost 2 years regardless of which router the lights were on.

Then I went code, edited the launch request as detailed

    class LaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
        """"""Handler for Skill Launch.""""""
        def can_handle(self, handler_input):
            # type: (HandlerInput) -> bool

Cake Walk didn't open. I got back

\-----------------

I've been having an issue with my Echo Dot's lately, when I ask Alexa to play my Liked Songs or My Music on Spotify, she'll reply saying ""Now playing your Liked Songs on Spotify"" and then just start playing random music that isn't in any playlist I have. I'm not sure when this started.

But my Liked Songs play fine if I do it manually from the desktop app or my android phone... I don't get it.

Does this have anything to do with not having Premium?",1,0.66,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/grc5zb/alexa_wont_play_spotify_liked_songs_via_voice/,Inkerlink,1590551094.0

Ah, gotcha. And here I was thinking it was Rosh Hashanah

**Me:** ""Hey Google, what is the purpose of Memorial Day?""  
**Google Assistant:** ""...Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May. It was formerly known as Decoration Day and commemorates all men and women who have died in military service for the United States.""

I'd chuckle if this was a one-off misfire. Instead, it's one more reason on a growing pile of frustrations that have me using my Echos/Dots less and my Google Homies more.
