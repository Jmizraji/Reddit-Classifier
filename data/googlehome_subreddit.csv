I wasn't able to find a similar post so please excuse any repeats.

I have a nice mix of Google hubs, homes, and minis. I have a group to cast to all the devices. That works great. I decided to create a smaller group for just two of the devices. When I go to create a group, the only device available is a Chromecast that is not part of the other group I have made.

Can a hub/home/mini be a part of multiple groups? I'm trying to figure out if that's my problem or if it is something else.

55,googlehome,iggcjw,t3_iggcjw,"Against all odds, trying to make 2 max speakers set up work","So even though I saw plenty of issues about this online, I just had to get 2 GH max speakers for my birthday. We have a small 1-bedroom apartment and it just seemed like the smart affordable solution. We were always pretty happy up until now with the rest of the GH products we purchased (we have 2 mini's, 1 chromecast ultra for the samsung TV and 1 chromecast audio for a Marshall Stanmore speaker).

As I saw online, you need a complicated setup to play from the TV without delay (connect from the TV optical to an analog converter, to a L/R splitter, to aux for both speakers).

My experience so far:

1. When playing anything on the TV not using the chromecast, the speakers have to be set to 100% and even then they're still kinda low.
2. This also means you have to mute the mic, otherwise whenever the assistant says something, the entire neighborhood can hear it. Which sucks, since now these are not smart speakers anymore.
3. In this set-up you cannot pair the 2 speakers to work as stereo pair (that will cause the delay issue with the TV). So when I play music I stream to the TV. This streams through the chromecast, so the volume is normal (very loud). I tried setting up routines to automatically set the volume down, but they almost never work.
4. Trying to combine the speakers to a speaker group and control the volume like that is also buggy: when the aux is playing music the speakers and group are unresponsive. when they do respond, changing the volume changes only one speaker and resets to a different value than was input.

Would love to know other people's xp and tips with this setup, and which of the issues are known bugs",1,1.0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/iggcjw/against_all_odds_trying_to_make_2_max_speakers/,Free_Butterscotch253,1598375325.0

First!  ""Start the school day"" command.  The Google Home device that hears the spoken command will play a school bell, simulate a busy school hallway sound, and rotate colors on the smart lights to simulate movement.  It's really cool!  BUT!  It will ONLY play the sounds on the speaker that heard the command.  I can't call it in a routine.  And, I can't get it to play on multiple speakers.   


Desired result:  call the command in a timed routine and have it play on all connected home devices.  


Second!  Family Bells.  Not that dissimilar to a routine that broadcasts a message to a specific speaker.  This feature was touted as helping keeping kids on track by sending alarms bundled with a message to a specific speaker.  It almost works perfectly, until multiple children need a timer at the same moment.  My kids Zoom meetings coincide, and Google will only play one of the scheduled bells on one of the speakers and ignore the rest.  I can offset one of the messages by a minute and have them work, but does it work for anybody else?  


Desired result:  schedule two family bells for two different rooms / speakers at the same time and have them both announce successfully.

I know that there's a setting that excludes low quality photos, but I should have that turned off, so it should show all the photos in the album. But the hub usually shows only a handful of the same photos, with once in a while a new photo, and that's it.

I'd like to know if it's possible to control the slideshow order on the nest hub, so I could set it to show oldest to newest photos, instead of the random mode it's set to now.",3,1.0,4,Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if7cod/controlling_the_slideshow_order_on_a_google_nest/,Yusunoha,1598204110.0

Since the pandemic, my wife and I have been working from home.  We decided now is the best time to upgrade our wifi.  We bought a Nest Wifi Router with 2 Wifi points for \~$350.  

Setup was a breeze and having the wifi points as speakers is brilliant.  I was recommending all my co-workers to invest in one as well. 

Last week we started having issues with the router dropping internet connection every 5 minutes.  I assumed it was our ISP (comcast) or the modem.  We replaced the modem, and had a comcast service tech come to our house to diagnose the issue.  The service was still working when we plugged in the old wifi router so that pointed us to the Nest Router being the culprit.   So we tried hardwiring into the router, and still had issues!

After 4 hours of chatting with the google customer service they decided the router should be replaced.  I sent them all the critical information but they refused to process the replacement.  They required an itemized receipt from the purchase.   I had purchased the router and wifi kit about a month ago, so the receipt was long gone.   They said there is absolutely no way for the replacement to proceed without it.  The google rep asked if I could go back to best buy and ask them to re-print a receipt for me.

So here I am, trying to get best buy to go against their policy and reprint a receipt for me.  I have wasted (between comcast, the modem and Google) 8+ hours simply trying to get the product to function.",2,0.75,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if6605/nest_wifi_nightmare/,Bensonian,1598200162.0

We have a single Google Home Mini, and a Spotify family plan. I'm set up to control my Spotify account with my voice, my wife with hers, my older child (6) with hers. And for my younger kid (4), I've set up a child account successfully and done the Assistant voice recognition for her successfully. But I can't get that last piece where I specify that Spotify is the default music program and then link it to her Spotify account.

With my older kid, I had set up a standard Google account years ago and then turned it into a managed kid account recently. I then got a screen-busted iPhone to be ""her"" phone, signed her in to Google Home and was able to link Spotify. But with the younger child, I had set her account up in the Family Link app, which I'm guessing is the issue. If I try to log her in to a Google Home account, it just...does nothing. I get an email saying that she was logged in and the list of thing that she's not able to do, but not specifically mentioning Google Home.

First, when I spoke to it, it says ‘your google home isn’t set up yet’, so I attempted to reconnect. I even factory reset. Nothing worked. Then it said, ‘unable to play music at this time’. So, I’ve given up at this point. I messaged Google themselves, and they’ve given me multiple solutions in which I’ve tried as well as online solutions- leaving it plugged in for 24 hours, unplugged for days, hitting the factory reset, reconnect to a different email, unplugging it 10 times, turning off the mic for a few minutes, etc.

Hi, I would like to know why I now have to pay a monthly subscription to listen to the music I bought from Google Play Music, on a smart speaker I purchased from Google. Why do I need to pay to listen to music I already paid for?

Yes, this is *****

I understand you have concern about Google play music. TO better assist you with that as you reached Google play store support, let me connect you to the correct department.

I'm sorry you're being asked to pay. I'll be happy to check this further for you.

By the way, am I chatting with *****?

Femi A. · 10:16 pm

Yes you are.

10:17 pm

F

Hi, *****!

Femi A. · 10:17 pm

I'm being asked to pay now because YouTube Music requires a subscription to listen to the music I already paid for on a speaker I already paid for.

10:17 pm

F

YouTube Music have 2 options same with Google Play Music.

You can use the free version and you can also subscribed to the membership.

Femi A. · 10:18 pm

I would like to know why Google feels the need to milk me for more money. This was a feature that wasn't a paid feature on Google Play Music

10:18 pm

F

If you have uploaded songs on YouTube Music, you can listen using the app for free.

Femi A. · 10:18 pm

With or without ads?

10:18 pm

F

I'm checking your account right now and I am so sorry but I don't see any purchased songs.

Where did you purchase the songs from? Did you upload it on Google Play Music?

Femi A. · 10:19 pm

Can I listen for free by asking my Google Nest Mini?

10:19 pm


Without ads?

Femi A. · 10:19 pm

I purchased from Google play music. I also uploaded thousands of songs from my music library

10:19 pm

Can I listen for free by asking my Google Nest Mini?

10:20 pm

F

Also, for YouTube Music, it is compatible with the Google Nest Mini.

Femi A. · 10:21 pm



To my uploaded library?

10:21 pm

So you should be able to use your Google Nest mini with it.

Femi A. · 10:21 pm



I was told I need to subscribe in order to play music from my library without ads on my Google nest mini

Is this true or not?

Without doing it from a phone or other device

10:23 pm

F

To be honest, Google Nest mini is a separate team than us. So I'm not sure how their process is. But YouTube Music is compatible with the Google Nest Mini device. So it should work since you have uploaded songs on it.

Would you like me to connect you to the Google Nest mini team later to check this further?

Femi A. · 10:24 pm

It doesn't. It requires a subscription.

No. I would like you to answer my question on if I can stream my library on a Google device. You're all part of the Google family so you should be able to provide me an answer without reconnecting me again.

10:25 pm

F

I am so sorry about this.

Femi A. · 10:27 pm

If not then connect me to your supervisor that can answer my question about being forced to pay a monthly fee to listen to music I already own on a speaker I already own.

10:27 pm

F

Let me check our resources if I can see any information about the Google Nest mini device.

Femi A. · 10:27 pm

It's not your fault. It's your companies fault.

It's not a Google nest mini problem, it's a YouTube music problem.

10:28 pm

F

Our supervisors are also only trained for YouTube Music. But in case I haven't found any information, I'll be definitely connecting you to them if they're availale.

Please give me 2 minutes to check this for you.

Femi A. · 10:28 pm

Thank you

10:29 pm

F

You're welcome. Thanks for your patience too. I'll be back.

Thanks for waiting!

I've checked the Google Nest help center and found this: https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7030379?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en-GB

I am so sorry.

The only free feature for now for YouTube Music to be played on Google Nest are genre's, mood or activity. But you can't specifically ask to play a specific song you've uploaded.

Free feature will work on it, but not for specific songs. I am so sorry.

Femi A. · 10:35 pm

So, to summarize, I DO need to pay monthly to listen to music I've paid for on a speaker I've paid for. Correct?

10:35 pm

F

I will take this as a feedback and hopefully the YouTube Music app free version will be compatible with the Google Nest Mini device.

I'm sorry to say this but yes. You need to have a membership for you to be able to use YouTube Music to play specific songs on a Google Nest mini device.

How I wish I have a better update to provide.

Femi A. · 10:36 pm

Thank you. I will be switching everything to a different service. Sad that I've invested hundreds of dollars to Google and that doesn't seem to be enough to just listen to my music. Thanks for the help.

10:37 pm

F

I am really sorry about this, *****.

Femi A. · 10:38 pm

You shouldn't need to be sorry - but it would be nice to get an apology from your multi-billion dollar company.

10:39 pm

F

I will definitely take this as an in app feedback.

Femi A. · 10:40 pm

Again - thank you for the help.

10:40 pm

F

I really hope that the app will be compatible with the Google Nest mini soon even for the free version.

Thanks for being kind to me. I really appreciate it.

Is there anything else I can help you out with today or any feedback I can take note of?

My main goal is to have a home ambient sound system throughout my apartment (living room, kitchen, two rooms and two bathrooms).

I can buy Google Home for 60€ and nest mini for 36€.

I'm more inclined to getting da Home because of sound quality, but on the other hand it's much bigger and less discrete than the nest mini. One thing that's holding me back is it's from 2016 so the possibility of it getting a newer improved version soon is high, which might make getting the nest mini more sense.

What's your opinion? Which one is more worth it? And what combination of devices would make sense for each room?

252,googlehome,icifpi,t3_icifpi,'Sorry that device has not been set up yet' when trying to turn TV on or off while assistant device is playing music,"Hi Reddit,
I have this weird bug, where under below circumstances I cannot switch my TV (connected to Chromecast) on or off.
I can easily trigger the 'Sorry that device has not been set up yet' (or similar, my GH speaks German) by having my TV on, then playing a song on e.g. spotify on my phone, then triggering assistant on my phone and saying 'turn the TV off' -> TV does not turn off and I get the above message.
However, when I stop spotify and say the same thing, it works.
It's the same with YouTube and also when it is not my phone playing spotify/YouTube, but any Mini / Nest Hub and I ask them to turn on or off the TV...

So summarized: Whenever I tell an assistant (on phone, Mini, Nest Mini, Nest Hub) to turn the TV on or off, WHILE on the device bringing up the assistant something is playing (Spotify, YouTube), it does not perform the action but instead tells me the message above. Whenever I end the playback on the device and ask again, it works.

Can anyone tell me, if it's just me (and my set up) or if it's really a bug..

I have a chromecast that's connected to my bedroom tv and everything is properly setup (CEC is on, etc).

However, if I rename it to ""Bedroom TV"" so that it makes more sense logically, I cannot turn the TV on by saying ""Hey google turn on my Bedroom TV"".

311,googlehome,ibgrpr,t3_ibgrpr,"""can not connect to the internet"" then ""this device is not set up yet..."" with Google Home and Mini on wifi without a password and cast firmware 1.49.218411 - SOLUTION sort of","""cast firmware **1.49.218411**"" issue that is happening with the Google Home and Mini(first gen devices, but not the newer 'Nest' versions) running on **unsecured networks**; and it gets kinda confusing because others might have kinda similar issues from other causes, but here the fix Google is recommending is that you set a password to access your wifi network and then rerun setup

the symptoms of this particular problem are

1. no password for wifi access
2. Google devices were working fine then suddenly they say ""can not connect to the internet""
3. older 1st gen Google Home and Mini that have recently updated to cast firmware 1.49.218411
4. if you try removing the devices from the app then reinstalling they will get to the last step where they connect to wifi and 'something went wrong' and they will further just respond with ""this device is not set up yet...""
5. if you do a 'factory reset', right before the final step the device might 'install an update', however the 'factory reset' does not clear the cast firmware nor reinstall a new one or the bad firmware
6. you might be able to still see the devices listed as connected to your wifi router just fine; and if you can still find them in your app, click 'settings' for them and scroll down to the bottom to check if they are running cast firmware 1.49.218411
7. you need to set a password on your wifi network these devices use, then they should work with cast firmware 1.49.218411 
8. log into your wifi router(usually something like  [http://192.168.1.1/Login.html](http://192.168.1.1/Login.html) ) and reconfigure it for password, then you will also have to give that password to all the other devices that use that wifi

really sucks that Google is still pushing out the 1.49.218411 update even tho they have gotten many reports for at least a month now that it has caused a huge problem for people that don't need to password protect their wifi ...I'm sure there are a lot of people out there with older Google Homes and Minis that just stopped using them - or have spent hours with tech support, which they just try to make it seem like we have done something wrong and they want us to painfully go thru all these basic steps over and over again - hopefully now they at least are asking if we have an unsecured wifi and to check for ***their*** bad cast firmware 1.49.218411 update

375,googlehome,iad5z2,t3_iad5z2,Casting with PowerAmp Music Player,"Hi. I have 4 Google devices placed around the home - 2x Google Homes, a Google Home Mini and a Google Home Hub, which are all in a speaker group together named 'Home'

I can cast my music to a specific speaker faultlessly, however when I try casting to the speaker group - so that music plays on all four speakers at once throughout the house - the music constantly stutters and freezes

I was previously advised to increase the buffer size in the PowerAmp settings (Settings > Audio > Output > Chromecast Output > Buffer Size). I turned it all the way up (400ms) and that seemed to fix the problem at first. However a few weeks later and it has started freezing again - this time worse than ever

Any advice on what could be causing this problem?

Thanks

Edit: The above relates to using the cast button within the PowerAmp app. I've just realised that if I go to the Google Home app > Groups  > 'Home' group > Cast My Audio I can mirror my phone through the speakers. So playing music through the phone now comes through the speakers - and it doesn't freeze. It's a good work around for the time being, but the music quality doesn't sound as good to my ear so i'd eally like to get it working via PowerAmp",1,1.0,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/iad5z2/casting_with_poweramp_music_player/,SCFC_Blaze,1597517859.0

402,googlehome,i9thp4,t3_i9thp4,Gapless is over on Google Home,"""Hey Google, play Dark Side of the Moon""

Ever listen to that album without gapless playback? Sucks doesn't it? The YTM fiasco has me scrambling for a replacement music service (I'm on the free trial for pretty much all of them) and I just realized something horrible. GPM is the only app that can perform gapless playback on Google speakers. YTM can't do it. Spotify can't do it. Apple music can't do it. I can't get Deezer to link to my Home account so I don't know if they can do it. With the death of GPM just around the corner, the ability to listen to albums like Sgt. Pepper on Home/Nest speakers without obnoxious gaps between songs is ending. no one else (including Google themselves) can do it!

I bought an Echo Dot to experiment with and Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music can all perform gapless playback on it, no problem.

I just want to come home from work, put my feet up and tell my assistant to play my favorite records and listen to them as the artists and producers intended. I've had that ability for years and soon it will be gone. Do I really have to replace all my speakers to get this very simple ability back? All the major streaming services can deliver gapless playback on Echo devices, why not Home/Nest? Finding a new service is one thing, replacing all my hardware is another. The only workaround I've found is mirroring via the Home app but that kinda defeats the purpose of having a digital assistant who responds to voice commands don't you think? Might as well go back to Bluetooth at that point.

Does anyone here have any insights into this? My house is decked out with Google speakers, I'd hate to replace them but they're really of no use to me if I can't enjoy the music that they deliver. At first I thought the forced move to YTM was obnoxious, but now it's going to get really expensive if this isn't sorted out.

I'm also curious how people have their speakers setup in a new remodel situation. I currently have home minis placed throughout the house but if there's a better way to hide them/make it a little more seamless that'd be ideal.

I just bought my grandad a Samsung tablet and he loves it. 

He also has a Philips 4k smart TV [no Android] which has a built in cast. 

He figured out that he can cast YouTube videos and such to the big screen. 

The issue is that the YouTube app finds the TV no problem, but other apps [the one he uses for online TV] doesn't find the tv at all. 

We have another tv with an external Chromecast upstairs, and that is detected everywhere. 

Has anybody faced this issue? And if so are there any solutions?

I can Bluetooth connect my 2 Google home max as a pair to my Sony AF8 Android TV. it has a audio delay of about 0.7 seconds. There is and A/V sync for  A2DP Bluetooth in the TV menu but does not seem to do anything.  I can do a group delay on the Max pair in the Google home app up to 200Ms this changes the sync but not to any acceptable level. Im assuming this actually delays the speakers even more. 
The delay is less when only working one speaker that is not paired. But when playing music over the two unpaired speakers there is a small audio delay hearable and no stereo. In paired mode they sound way better.
There is also the option to use 3,5mm headphone connection, I have one in my TV as well that can be configured as an aux out.

463,googlehome,i8mhwd,t3_i8mhwd,Nest Hello won't connect with app after moving to new WiFi router.,"Not sure whether I should post in here or r/nest.

I've had a nest hello working fine for six months. Today I changed broadband provider and had to set everything up with the new WiFi.

The nest hello stubbornly refuses to work. It connects to the WiFi but I just can't get it to connect to the nest app or show up in the GH app. 

After initially changing the WiFi I had the steady blue circle, but the image wouldn't load. Neither would any of the history.

After a lot of messing about, I deleted it from the nest app and eventually did a factory reset (I had to delete and reinstall the nest thermostat to get it to work also, although it didn't need a factory reset.) and fresh install. It gets as far as accepting the WiFi password but as it tries to register with nest, it chimes and flashes a yellow circle twice, finally failing with the error code NC009 (15.5).

I've logged into the WiFi router as admin (although it's all a bit beyond me) and can see that the nest hello has been assigned a Mac address, so I just can't figure out what's wrong with it. I've even tried an installation with the firewall disabled and the Upnp security disabled. It still results in the same error code.

This is really frustrating. Anyone got any ideas? I'm in the UK and it's a BT Smarthub2.



One final bit of information.

We've had a hell of a lightning strike, very close to the house and I could swear that there was a small spark from behind the router, but there's no sign of any evidence of arcing and absolutely everything else (GH speakers, Nest thermostat, Tradfri lights, Harmony hub), are working fine, so this is probably a red herring.

The LED bulbs don't have this problem, obviously, but they're just way too bright. 

Long story long, I don't need anything too fancy, just some simple, dimmable white light bulbs. I'd really prefer bulbs that had a color temperature control (even a very simple one) or that defaulted to the warmer look of the incandescent bulbs.

542,googlehome,i7e30y,t3_i7e30y,Are Nest mesh routers what I need?,"Howdy!  I live in a one story, two bedroom house built in the 30s.  The walls are mega-thick, and somewhere under layers of latex is some lead paint.  The basic floor plan is a big, conjoined living room/family room area, with two bedrooms at the far end of the house.

Our router is on the mantle in the front of the house.  This is where the Ethernet jack is, and where we tend to spend most of our gaming/TV/hosting time.  The router is powerful enough to get decent signal to the back of the house.  We can stream Netflix, etc no problem.

However, because of COVID-19 we're doing a lot more bandwith-intensive activities like streaming over Twitch, podcast recording and Zoom calling.  All of that takes place in BR 1.  We have a computer in the living room closer to the router, but it's not conducive to home office work or any of the aforementioned activities.

We're considering buying a two pack of Nest wifi routers, but I'm not sure I know the technology well enough to be confident they'd help.  Are they just wifi routers?  Do they need to be hooked up to the Ethernet?  Or are they capable of like, absorbing and amplifying the existing wifi signal?

I'm a huge fan of Google Home and we have tons of devices in the Google Home infrastructure (Home minis, Chromecasts, Pixel phone etc).  So I'm hoping this is the answer to our problem, but I wanted to check with folks in the know before I commit.

546,googlehome,i7cmol,t3_i7cmol,"Google Nest Hub, Hubitat & Inovelli Light Switches","Hey folks! I'm moving from a smart-tech-free studio apartment into my first condo and am looking into setting up a smart home network in my new home. I've been researching and slowly acquiring items I'd like to add as they go on sale while I wait for move-in day. I've already decided (for various reasons) on Google Assistant as my voice assistant and Hubitat Elevation as my hub. I'm now researching the best ways to start establishing a good base for my smart home usage... once I recoup from the closing costs. :)

I'm currently researching light switches, with the intent on eventually replacing all the light switches with a single brand for a consistent look and (hopefully) easier customer service if there are any issues. I've been bouncing between a few different choices, but I quite like the [Inovelli](https://inovelli.com/) brand of light switches. I'm specifically looking at using Red series dimmer switches for most switches, dipping into Red On/Off or Red Fan + Light as needed, and depending on the number of switches using Black Dimmers or Black On/Offs for closets and other rarely-used areas.

However, one thing I'm having a hard time looking into is how Google Assistant would interact with the Inovelli switches. I understand that Hubitat will allow me to control the switches with voice commands regardless, but ideally I'd like to be able to use my Hub to control lights throughout the condo as well, I naturally gravitate to touch controls when I have options and all the videos make controlling lights through the hub pretty slick. Am I correct though, that since Inovelli does not have the ""Works With Google"" distinction, this would not be possible? It's a minor thing, but that may drive me towards Caséta instead, if it has the functionality with the Google Nest Hub. (Otherwise, I prefer the look of the Inovelli lights and the many options for scene controls with multi-presses.)

Apologies if this is basic, but as I'd like to keep my switches consistent I'd like to know before investing in one, and I couldn't find discussion on this interaction specifically.

567,googlehome,i70i0k,t3_i70i0k,I've made a Tool to filter Gmails and Trigger a IFTTT notification," I've made a very simple Google Script that will check for the arrival of any specified Gmail and then trigger any IFTTT service, like turn on a light or whatever. It doesn't need any other software or connections and only takes a few minutes to set up.

You can [find it here](https://script.google.com/d/1Y2wUrpTTZAFV7UcSsCl9bKP0a_Kv6prmIXgZqQdSohKj3-95AUrqwoPM/edit?usp=sharing) and the instructions are included. This is how it works:

* First you add the Script to your own Google Apps Scripts, add your webhook key and save it.
* Then create a Gmail 'Filter' to label the specific emails you want to trigger IFTTT.
* When the script runs it'll detect the emails, send a webhook event, and remove the trigger label.

You can use it to change a light colour, or flash a light. Or you could even use it to unlock a door or open the garage with an email, or write to a spreadsheet or anything with IFTTT you can think of.

It's very simple, so you can easily read it and see it's safe to use even if you don't code. It won't mess with your emails, all it will do is add the extra label on arrival, and then remove it again when the webhook is sent. To remove it just delete the Script.

It adds the number of labelled emails with the webhook just in case you want to write to a spreadsheet - the number will appear. You can edit the name of the label and can also inhibit the removal of the label. (That's useful as you could for example, set a LIFX light to 'breathe' continually and it will revert automatically to the original settings when the email is deleted or label removed.)

\---------------------------------------------------

Hope it might be useful. Let me know of any glitches and I'll adjust it.

Mon, Jun 29, 3:10 PM to googlehome-support Hi. ISP is Verizon with a FiOS router provided by them.  
All other Google speakers in the house work fine and do not disconnect from WiFi. These are all Google Home Mini's.  
The problem of the Google Home Max disconnecting from WiFi is widely reported in support pages on the web, so I don't think it is related to any equipment in my house.  
Thanks.

My apologies, I was not able to get back to you right away. I'm sorry to hear that you're having an issue with your Google Home Max. We'll be needing additional details to further investigate. We'll be needing the firmware of your Home Max. Here's how to check:**Find the current firmware version**

1. Open the Google Home app 📷.
2. Tap your device 📷 Settings 📷.
3. Scroll to the bottom and look for Cast firmware version: X.XXX.XXXXX.

\-----------------------------------  
Tue, Jun 30, 5:40 PM to googlehome-support Hi. The firmware version is:  
1.46.195690  
Just to explain further: this is a two-fold problem. The Max frequently disconnects from WiFi between uses. It reconnects (shows up as connected in Google Home app) if I unplug it and then plug it back in.   
The second problem is, often after playing for a half hour or so (whether from Spotify or Google Podcasts, for example), the sound completely degrades to something that resembles “sampling”. I could make a memo recording of it with my phone, if you like.   
All of this only happens on the Max. The Mini’s all work fine. Again, Max is very close to the WiFi router — about 12 feet.   
Thanks!  
\------------------------  
Tue, Jun 30, 7:13 PM to googlehome-support Also interesting: When the Max has disconnected itself from WiFi, if I say “Hey Google, play music on Spotify”, it will play music. But it still doesn’t show up as connected to WiFi in the Google Home app. If the Max is playing music this way, and I go into Spotify and select my Group of “All Speakers”, music starts playing on the Google Home Mini’s in other parts of the house, but the Max gives a message that it has stopped playing because “your Spotify account is already in use”.   
Thanks.

Sat, Jul 4, 5:46 PM to googlehome-support I followed your instructions and sent feedback. Also, attached is ascreenshot of the Google Home app after the Google Home Max has not been used for a couple of hours.  
More information:  
If I say “play music on Spotify“, the Google home Max says “sorry, I’m not connected to the Internet“. However, if I say “hey google, good morning“, it plays my name, the current weather, my schedule, and the current headlines. So it’s clearly connected to Wi-Fi and the Internet, but there’s a glitch somewhere. 

 \------------------------------  
Sat, Jul 4, 6:03 PM to googlehome-support Correction: If I say, Hey google, play music on Spotify”, it will! But it STILL shows up as not connected to the internet, and I can’t control the Max from the Google Home app. And I can’t play music from the Max + google home Mini speakers (in other rooms) simultaneously. Very strange. If I unplug and replug the Max, it shows as connected to WiFi once again.   
\-------------------------------  
Sat, Jul 4, 6:46 PM to googlehome-support Second problem — related??? Every 15 minutes or so (unpredictable) the sound deteriorates to almost nothing (listen to attached recording), and then recovers on its own a few minutes later. (this doesn’t happen on google home mini speaker located right nearby.)

603,googlehome,i6hkqo,t3_i6hkqo,How do I get the assistant to play music that I have purchased and downloaded?,"I'm not a big music listener. The last time I bought music was from Google Play Music (Using Google rewards cash. Which is always nice.). I was able to get the assistant to play the album by emphasising the *MY* in ""Hey Google. Play *my* Tom Petty album.

I don't listen to music often enough to warrant paying for a streaming service and free versions don't really cater for my tastes (which tend to hover around the 80s). So I was happy ( and indeed, more comfortable ) purchasing the odd downloadable album, or ripping one of the fossilized CDs I occasionally stumble across in the boxes in the attic and adding it to my Google Play Music library.

The assistant seemed to lose the ability to play music from my library a while back and I just assumed it was the usual ""Google must have broken something again""; until yesterday, when my wife announced she was ""in the mood for a bit of White snake"". There doesn't seem to be any way to purchase music through Google Play Music anymore and apparently it is being rolled into YouTube Music. I have migrated my account (I have a nasty feeling I might regret that, having seen the problems this has caused ex Nest account holders), but it seems that YouTube Music is all about the hard selling of its streaming service. I could find no option to purchase tracks or albums from a ""store"".

Edit.

I forgot to mention that YouTube Music won't even let you cast to a GH device unless you sign up for their ""Premium"" service.

I sulked for a bit, then decided to try Amazon music (another service that seems desperate for you to sign up for a monthly fee). Interestingly; Amazon music *can* cast to Google Home devices *and* (admittedly after having to do a web search) alongside Prime music, HD music and any other of the multitude of different streaming services Amazon seems to offer, there is an Amazon digital music store! Somewhere to purchase a downloadable MP3 that will show up in my Amazon Music library that I can then stream to my GH devices.

The purchased music is also compatible with third party apps like Poweramp...... I'm wondering wether I can ask Google assistant to play specific tracks from Poweramp as a workaround for requesting music via voice command?

Update. No. I can't.

This surely can't be what Google intended? Amazon is now getting my money for purchases of music and the Amazon Music app has *more* functionality in the GH ecosystem than Google's own service?

610,googlehome,i6a0ll,t3_i6a0ll,Alternatives to this fiasco,"I own 5 minis, one home speaker, one nest hub and a Google assistant enabled LG soundbar. Other than a few lights I primarily use assistant/home for music and media. I'm subscribed to GPM (family plan) and I use it like crazy. Besides listening to music all over the house, I use routines to automatically play ambient ocean wave sounds in the bedroom just before I go to bed and some nice birdsong for when I wake up in the morning. When the demise of GPM was announced and my turn to migrate to YTM came up I tried, I really tried. Problem is none of my Google Home products would play playlists off YTM and my ambient tracks are all playlists. YTM's inability to perform gapless playback while casting was another bummer. I reset GPM as my default music provider hoping they just hadn't got around to implementing that stuff yet but now they've managed to break routines altogether so no matter what service you use it's just not going to happen. All I need is for a specific playlist to play at a specific time on a specific speaker and Google has managed to render themselves incapable of performing that task. Problem is, what's the alternative? Alexa? That could work I guess but the music locker at GPM/YTM is kind of important to me. I own tons of mp3s that aren't on any streaming service. Apple Music is the only alternative I can find that lets you upload music. I've already ordered an Echo Dot to experiment with but has anyone else tried it? How viable is Alexa/Apple Music? I was thinking of getting a Fire Stick which has an Apple Music app which would work with the LG soundbar which is my main music speaker. I can replace the minis and home speakers with Echos but that soundbar was damn expensive.

I really enjoyed the Google ecosystem back when it worked but I'm not very enthusiastic about the direction they're heading these days and despite the money I've sunk into it, I'm not willing be the subject of Google's experiments anymore. I just want a system that works.

640,googlehome,i5pwk3,t3_i5pwk3,Question about setting up multiple Nest Hub Max's in one home,"Hoping someone can help:  My parents bought one Nest Hub Max, and then a second one.  My father set each one up, and of course, messed up the set up in every way possible, so a bunch of things are problematic.  Tomorrow I'm going to go over and reset them both and start from the beginning, and would love some advice.

The general question is about how to keep the accounts and people from getting mixed up.  I know once a hub is set up, you can add/invite people to it (or to the home?).  But my question is about who is best to be the primary account its setup with.  He set one up with his account, and one up with her account... and at some point ended up putting them in 2 separate ""homes"" (really messy).

When I reset them and start over, is it best that they are both set up with the same primary account, and then just invite the other (plus I'll invite myself)?  Can they not be in the same home if they are set up separately?  In general, my mom spends most her day in one room, and my dad in the other (as he works), so I'd like to be able to call either of them specifically without interrupting the other.  A related question is, should I set up each one with a different duo number, for the respective person, same as the account?  I'm engineer, and like to understand how things work... But I'm just not getting how it all works underneath, between the primary account, the joint accounts, and everyone's settings in the Assistant/Home/Nest apps (e.g., are settings those for the Device, or for the person's personal settings on that Device?).  To make matters worse, my dad has my mom's account linked on his iPhone for some strange reason.  So right now all calls and notifications and everything are all going to the wrong place.

Sorry for all the questions.  I'm just hoping someone can help me understand a few of these things better before I spend tomorrow starting it all over.",1,0.58,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/i5pwk3/question_about_setting_up_multiple_nest_hub_maxs/,Babalou0,1596847855.0

My daughter, who is about to turn 12 however, is very interested in setting up her bedroom as a smart bedroom. My issue is that ill probably need to do it with her and I'm not sure where to start so I'm hoping I can ask a few questions here (and please forgive me if they're stupid questions):

1. Is it possible to set up just one room or should I buy the mesh and set it up across the whole house?
2. What is the most appropriate set up for a teenagers room? She wants to be able to play music and get a smart bulb to control the lights, maybe some other minor stuff as she figures it out.
3. Her bedroom, and her sisters, don't get internet. They are too far away from the modem to get WiFi. Its strong throughout most of our house except for their two bedrooms at the back of the house. Is this an issue? If so, what is recommended?
4. In general, what is the best way to set this all up? Her birthday is coming up and I think this would be a great gift for her, but I don't want her disappointed if I've got the wrong thing and it doesn't end up working.

I thought it was quite weird but dismissed it as the google home hub can be quite weird at times. But then I noticed that it happened again 3 times today.

Because of the random nature of the issue, I can't really document it on camera without like filming the google home for like multiple hours or something.

I find this issue quite annoying however because I almost exclusively use the home hub as a clock. This is because it will never become too fast or too slow like a normal clock and I don't have to fiddle with anything on daylight savings time. It's been kind of a life change actually since I got it in 2018. But it kind of defeats the purpose of having an always on clock if sometimes it is randomly off or rebooting.

I just invested in a few Google Nest Mini devices, two for my under 13 years of age kids. This might have been a mistake. They both have Google child accounts, with family link. I am unable to add them to our home in Google Home due to this.

There are various help topics which says it can be done, but with limited functionality. Some say it cannot be done, which seems more true. One of many reasons I want this to work is so that we can all use the speakers to play Spotify music individually. This in turn requires me to set up a load of new Spotify accounts (why simply upgrading to a Family account and be allowed multiple streams from one account is beyond me). 

There is the rant. Here is the question: Can I expect my new googlified speaker home to work with full functionality for my family members despite them being underage? Or is the message from Google that using a family system with kids under the age of 13 is going to be a hassle, so one might as well not bother until they are older?

I'm currently in the process of trying to improve my laziness by making my house as smart as possible.Recently we purchased 3 ceiling fans (1 for each of the bedrooms), which are controlled through an IR remote.To convert these into smart devices, I purchased a Tuya Smarthome compatible IR blaster which should be compatible with 99,99% of all devices, and in the rare case it isn't, you should be able to create a custom ""DIY"" remote using the original one to learn the IR commands.

Just my luck, I'm part of the 0,01%...Turns out to create a DIY remote in the Smarthome app, which identifies as a fan, you need to create a DIY fan, after which you teach it the IR commands.Unfortunately, this DIY remote always expects:

1. 1 button to toggle the fan's power
2. 1 button to adjust the fan's speed
3. 1 button to adjust the direction

Unfortunately, my fan uses 4 buttons for just the first 2 options.

1. Turn fan Off
2. Turn fan speed to low
3. Turn fan speed to medium
4. Turn fan speed to high

When buttons 2-4 are pressed, these also start the motor when it's stopped.

Even though I can create a custom remote, which is able to learn all the commands I need, this remote can only be used in the Smarthome app.  Google Assistant/Google Home does not recognize this device as a fan.I know I should be able to go through IFTTT, but I always get ""I'm sorry, this device doesn't seem to be setup yet"" when I give the ""This"" command (e.g. ""Turn off master bedroom fan"").

What I'm looking for is a similar IR blaster, which will allow me to create a custom fan (with different power on/off buttons and different buttons for speed!) which is usable in Google Home.Any ideas?",6,0.88,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/i4rq4t/looking_for_a_way_to_control_an_iroperated/,Boulliebeest,1596720207.0

what i'd like to do is have the kids play music on that nest unit

and simultaneously, i can play different music on the google home speaker in the living room

bonus points if it can be separate spotify accounts used so i my weekly AI driven spotify stuff isnt polluted by what the kids are listening to.

Occasionally, it looks like there is some text there, but it scrolls up the screen so fast it can't be read and can't be scrolled/all i see is a blank page, no voice, no text other than ""customize is the garage door open routine""

I've setup this exact routine in the past and it's worked, and i've tried deleting/re-creating the routine, as well as unsubscribing/resubscribing to the google assistant service through myq.  Seems to be more of a google assistant issue with the routine specifically as the straight up voice command works without issue.

I recently moved and so I setup a new ""home"" through the Google Home App. I have 6 Philips Hue lights that worked perfectly in the previous home and were all linked. Once I moved, I first deleted the old home (I did not remove the devices first as I didn't think that was a necessary step).

Now, the Philips Hue app works and I have the new rooms setup where I can turn the lights on or off, however, the Google Home app does not work. A few things are happening:

\- First, Philips Hue is able to link to the Google Home app 

\- The Google Home app pulls in the lights from Philips Hue, two of the lights are placed in the correct rooms (Kitchen & Bedroom) - these two lights do not work via voice command and I cannot turn them on via the app either. The other 4 lights are in a ""Linked to You"" box saying that they are not in the home. 

\- When I attempt to add a light to a room it first asks to ""Choose a Home"", so I choose the new home. It confirms that it has been moved into the new home. Then I click ""Move Device"" which allows me to select a room, which I do... But then I get an error message ""There was a problem communicating with Google. Please wait a few moments"". This has been going on for a few days now, so I don't think that that is the problem.

\- The lights also show up as ""Not Responding"", when I try to reconnect the Hue account to each individual light - they show as though they are responding, but no commands work, and when I attempt to add to a room they go back to the not responding phase. 

\- I have tried unlinking the apps, reconnecting, so on and so forth including factory resetting the Philips Hue hub and resetting. I have used the ""Okay Google, Sync Devices"" command to no avail. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Home app as well.

Upon listening to the recordings, all I heard is high frequency sounds similar to that when two microphones or walkie talkies frequencies cross. It’s pretty eerie and only happens in one room of the house.

Some of the other sounds, sound almost like distant bag pipes or phone notifications but at a higher pitch.

The recordings happen between 1am to 6am with one or two notifications from 12am, 8am, 11pm.

I’m concerned because the recordings sound nothing like glass breaking and as far as I can tell, no glass has been broken and we haven’t had any recent sounds that could explain such phenomena.

As of writing this, the notifications go back as far as July 15th up to July 29th.

Does anyone have an explanation or idea? Is this what I’m supposed to hear or is my google just going nuts or something worse?

UPDATE: Talked to my parents, who sleep in the room where the sound occurs, and they think it might be the bug zapper we have in the backyard that is causing the priority event warning to go off but I don’t believe that might be the cause since we have 2 other google homes in equal distance of the zapper and none of those have picked up the sound or sent us a glass breaking heard notification.

863,googlehome,i15e3y,t3_i15e3y,"""Would you still like that to play on speaker pair"" and other stupid Google speaker group problems.","Hi all,

I'm within the Google Home eco-system and getting really frustrated. Currently I have the following setup:

* 1x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the office
* 2x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Kitchen
* 1x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Bathroom
* 2x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Bedroom (paired)
* 1x Chromecast Audio hooked up to my Living Room Speakers

Now to the issues:

1. If I'm asking google to play music for the first time and request the music to play on my speaker group which includes ALL the speakers, it's a total hit or miss. 80% of the time it never works. 
2. However, if I ask google to play music, and let it play on the speaker I requested it on, it will play -- and then I can immediately ask Google to play it on my speaker group and voila, works like magic. Works almost 100% of the time. What the fuck?
3. Then sometimes, when I'm asking Google to play some music, it keeps asking me ""Would you still like that to play on Bedroom Pair"". It's literally the most annoying thing ever and ridiculous. It also happens to always do that on the most random times. How can I get google to never ask me that question ever again? 
   1. Occasionally, it will ask me ""Do you still want to play that on everywhere (my speaker group) and if I say yes -- it does nothing. Literally nothing. It just twinkles some dots and goes away. Uh, okay. 

I have other issues with the eco-system similar to everyone else, such as crappy GUI, it getting stupider and me having to yell, and just stupid random stuff. However, I like to listen to alot of music and one of the reasons I got myself into the eco-system was for a smart home/multi-room audio setup. The implementation is just horrid. I literally have a full wi-fi mesh system setup -- and I read that  Chromecast Audios can cause some issues due to its connectivity and I even put one of my mesh satellite systems right next to the chromecast but it still works like junk.

Any suggestions? I apologize if I come off a little aggressive, it's just been very frustrating! Hoping there is a solution!

3. General UI: The UI is a pain in the ass and could be so much cleaner and more dense to get a better overview without the needs to scroll for ages.

# Timers and Utilities for Google Assistant and IFTTT

It’s very quick to set up, maybe only ten or twenty minutes if you can use a mouse and can cut and paste. If you make sure you have the IFTTT Webhook service already activated, & Google Assistant already connected in your IFTTT account, it should be fairly easy, and it needs no other logins or any extra software. The different functions are split into separate threaded posts to make it easy to follow and then add different parts as needed. The only part you have to actually set-up is Timer-1. The other functions are enabled by simply adding extra applets once you have got that first one working.

**Reasons why it’s a good method:**

* It’s all under your own control, using just your accounts at IFTTT and Google. There are no other apps or any software to install, no external 3rd party API links, or any local hardware to maintain so it should be reliable too.
* It’s very secure, you could even share device activation links (using separate scripts) without exposing your IFTTT key. You already have Google and IFTTT accounts so there’s nothing more you need and nowhere else you need to login. Google also regulates the permissions that any script is allowed, so it's safe.
* It’s simple. Once you've set it up, every function is by voice control. You don't really need to go back to the script for anything, just set it up and forget it. Your voice timers will just work with whatever timed request you say. And there is no app to install or setup & config files to backup, so you can modify your setup from any computer or phone. A simple voice timer to control ALL your devices needs only a single applet, and then the event triggers for each device take only seconds to set up. 
* It’s useful and versatile and it doesn’t have to be just about lights & switches, you can use it to control any IFTTT-THAT service, or pull in API data from elsewhere to make events conditional. You can also set up 'hard coded' applets (GA or Alexa) with simple quick voice commands for frequently repeated timers. You can even trigger timers using Tasker or any service that can send a webhook.",3,1.0,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/i0nd6j/easy_timers_and_utilities_for_google_assistant/,Godberd,1596120654.0

907,googlehome,i0cnf4,t3_i0cnf4,Nest / Google Home Integration is a P.O.S.,"We have a nest with a ton of nest cameras - indoors and out, of course.  I made the mistake of integrating with google home, which was seemless and automatic going in - super easy!  However, I have no idea why anyone would think this was a good idea.  It got me absolutely nothing in terms of features or functionality or 'smart home', and created a ton of problems.  First of all, it adds a layer of indirection and obfuscation on top of the nest interface, with less functionality, which is just dumb and annoying.  Next, it busted my wife's access to nest because she didn't want to mess with google home (smart woman).  Note: If this were designed and implemented properly, it would be ANOTHER interface to the nest ecosystem via google home.  That way, if you didnt like it - you could just access it via your nest account.  That is what I insanely thought they had done, in which case my wife could have still accessed everything. Sadly, that is now how they built it.  And my wife was locked out of nest unless I added her to google home.  Which means she couldnt see the baby cam.  So I reluctantly added her to google home, against her wishes, which would clear it all up, right?  Nope... it allowed her access to the thermostat, but none of the cameras.  None of the cameras got added automatically for her access and it wants me to re-add them.  It wants me to go into her nest app (not google home) and add all 10 cameras individually all over again.  Some of these are mounted high up outside.  So... apparently the brilliant folks at google home didnt bother gather the full nest config (thermo, cameras, etc) - or let it be accessible by users added to google home?  Oh yeah..  also, I tried removing the nest account from google home, and re-adding it.  Doesnt help.  Also - once you've done this, the google password overrides your previous login, so there is no way to 'go back'.  

What a great way to take a perfectly good product and completely f\*\*\* it up.  I hope someone from google home is reading this.  You are technical imbeciles.  

The only 'solution' that I have found, for this exact problem, is that someone basically rebuilt their system by removing it from google home, creating a new nest account, re setup the nest with that account, and and re-added all of the devices.  I'm likeliy going to have to do that anyway because I'll need to re-add all of the cameras for my wife's phone since google home didnt migrate them.    

Seemless and automatic going in, then it screws your whole system and it's a nightmare to get out.  Nice work, google.

The other GH alternatives, Spotify and Deezer, are problematic for those who have large personal music libraries of thousands and thousands of songs and dozens and dozens of playlists. (Fuck Spotify's ""local files"" bullshit). 

I'm in the midst of a 6 month free trial with Apple Music, which works absolutely seamlessly when it comes to large music collections. All of my songs and playlists are perfectly duplicated in the cloud. I can cast anything in my library from my phone to whatever GH device I choose. 

What I can't do, though, is tell a GH device to play something from my Apple Music library, the same way I used to do with Google Play Music.

958,googlehome,hz7006,t3_hz7006,What should I buy for entertainment center lighting?,"I have a TV stand with two minimalistic end tables on each side. I want to add colored lighting behind the TV and at the bottom side of each end table. I do not care if they are controlled together or separately (especially if one way is cheaper). 

I am thinking LED strips but I am wondering if there is a way to have 3 separate sections of light across the entertainment center. I am assuming there is a way to split a strip up and use some sort of 3ish feet connector cable? I would like to do that instead of buying 3 separate controller/strip boxes and cut them short. I just get overwhelmed by all the parts and wiring, knowing what works with what. 

Can someone link me to what all I could by to make this work? 
If there is another option besides strip lights I would like to hear.",1,1.0,3,Other,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/hz7006/what_should_i_buy_for_entertainment_center/,cjsleme,1595906132.0

I live in an apartment building and people from the other apartments are connecting to my nest and playing music. This is extremely annoying and makes me want to completely unplug it. I feel as if this feature should have been a feature out of the box, but it is possible to be added, that would be great.",1,1.0,9,Features WishList,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/hz6r4p/please_please_please_add_the_ability_to_lock/,8Bitwolves,1595905110.0

Part of that is getting enough sleep and not wasting the day away. And I want to set it for midnight. It's 9:15 pm  where I live, and I want to go to bed at 12:30 or midnight. I usually can't fall asleep until 4-6 am. And I have more stuff I have to do before I can go to bed anyways. And it keeps setting the time to tomorrow at noon. What can I do?
