0,alexa,igp1yw,t3_igp1yw,Is there a way to make Alexa behave like a cuckoo clock?,"I was looking at the Alexa app on my phone and Im having a little trouble navigating the new UI so maybe I just cant find a setting but is there a way to make Alexa anounce the hour on the hour between certain times of the day like a cuckoo clock would or the way a digital watches beep every hour

I searched the skills but didnt see anything.",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/igp1yw/is_there_a_way_to_make_alexa_behave_like_a_cuckoo/,Jedi_Lucky,1598403368.0
1,alexa,igomz3,t3_igomz3,how does Alexa on Samsung TVs?,"I bought a 2019 Samsung TV 8 series a year ago and I recently bought an Alexa and I clearly remember it saying on the box it works with Alexa and Google. I connected alexa and it says it is not sure what I mean when I say ""Alexa go to channel 11"", ""Alexa turn up the volume""  or ""Alexa open up youtube"" , it only understands me when I say ""Alexa turn off/on the TV"". Do I need to set up specific skills? I would think alexa would already know some of these basic skills especially changing volume and channel",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/igomz3/how_does_alexa_on_samsung_tvs/,iMakeDatBedRock,1598401767.0
2,alexa,ignnkk,t3_ignnkk,Limited Alexa playlist?,"So I bought an Echo last week, I like it. Mainly to play music in the background. I cancelled my cable and along with it, lost the streaming music channels. I noticed though that there is a shit-ton of repetition from a very small playlist on all the genres I selected with ""Alexa, play jazz"" or whatever I pick. It's like 30 songs over and over again. I have Amazon Premium, so is there something else I have to pay for to expand this playlist?",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/ignnkk/limited_alexa_playlist/,alan13446,1598398155.0

Doesn’t matter if we’re controlling from our phones but playing on alexa, or asking her to play music, she no longer know she’s playing music. Anyone else??

And yes, my gen 3 dots have been acting up for months, while the Plus and gen 1 dot are rock solid. Ugh.",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/igjy43/streaming_spotify_alexa_next_what_would_you_like/,RedBeard254,1598386002.0
4,alexa,igg5o3,t3_igg5o3,"Alexa ""doesn't know how to set all lights to that setting""","Hey everyone,

I have Alexa in my bedroom, bathroom, and living room. I have multiple ceiling and lamp light fixtures connected to Alexa. For more than a year I've been able to say commands like ""Alexa, brighten all the lights of 100%"" or ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"" or ""Alexa, brighten living room lights to 50%""

But now something must've happened and when asked to brighten all the lights to 100% Alexa responds by saying ""I don't know how to set all lights to that setting""

Any advice on how to fix this? I suspect I need to rename some of my room arrangements, but I'm not sure what exactly is the problem",0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/igg5o3/alexa_doesnt_know_how_to_set_all_lights_to_that/,needakeepatit,1598374785.0
5,alexa,igdngs,t3_igdngs,My Alexa(s) are on drugs.,"I have 5 Alexa pods.  All in different rooms of the house, each with their own name.  I have the app as well and can control then all at any time with my phone with no issues.

Recently, I can be in room A, verbally tell Alexa to play a song and it plays in room B.  This is happening with 3 of the pods.  I have not added or taken away any pods recently, nothing has changed with location.  Any idea why this is happening with 3 of my pods?  

This only happens with verbal commands.  If using my phone app and i tell Room A to play, it plays in room A.

I had to create new ones, but just glad they work.  If anyone was having trouble with this I’d recommend remaking the routine.

8,alexa,ig72yb,t3_ig72yb,Can a routine be called from within a routine?,"Ultimately, I would like variations of the voice command for a routine. As I can’t do that the alternative is to create multiple routines each with its own voice command. What would be great is to create the one routine and then the variations to call it.

Not only would it make things quicker to set up but also be easier if the routine needs to be changed.",4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/ig72yb/can_a_routine_be_called_from_within_a_routine/,coldunn,1598338323.0
