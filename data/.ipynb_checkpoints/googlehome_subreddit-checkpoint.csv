13,googlehome,iggcjw,t3_iggcjw,"Against all odds, trying to make 2 max speakers set up work","So even though I saw plenty of issues about this online, I just had to get 2 GH max speakers for my birthday. We have a small 1-bedroom apartment and it just seemed like the smart affordable solution. We were always pretty happy up until now with the rest of the GH products we purchased (we have 2 mini's, 1 chromecast ultra for the samsung TV and 1 chromecast audio for a Marshall Stanmore speaker).

As I saw online, you need a complicated setup to play from the TV without delay (connect from the TV optical to an analog converter, to a L/R splitter, to aux for both speakers).

My experience so far:

1. When playing anything on the TV not using the chromecast, the speakers have to be set to 100% and even then they're still kinda low.
2. This also means you have to mute the mic, otherwise whenever the assistant says something, the entire neighborhood can hear it. Which sucks, since now these are not smart speakers anymore.
3. In this set-up you cannot pair the 2 speakers to work as stereo pair (that will cause the delay issue with the TV). So when I play music I stream to the TV. This streams through the chromecast, so the volume is normal (very loud). I tried setting up routines to automatically set the volume down, but they almost never work.
4. Trying to combine the speakers to a speaker group and control the volume like that is also buggy: when the aux is playing music the speakers and group are unresponsive. when they do respond, changing the volume changes only one speaker and resets to a different value than was input.

Would love to know other people's xp and tips with this setup, and which of the issues are known bugs",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/iggcjw/against_all_odds_trying_to_make_2_max_speakers/,Free_Butterscotch253,1598375325.0

First!  ""Start the school day"" command.  The Google Home device that hears the spoken command will play a school bell, simulate a busy school hallway sound, and rotate colors on the smart lights to simulate movement.  It's really cool!  BUT!  It will ONLY play the sounds on the speaker that heard the command.  I can't call it in a routine.  And, I can't get it to play on multiple speakers.   


Desired result:  call the command in a timed routine and have it play on all connected home devices.  


Second!  Family Bells.  Not that dissimilar to a routine that broadcasts a message to a specific speaker.  This feature was touted as helping keeping kids on track by sending alarms bundled with a message to a specific speaker.  It almost works perfectly, until multiple children need a timer at the same moment.  My kids Zoom meetings coincide, and Google will only play one of the scheduled bells on one of the speakers and ignore the rest.  I can offset one of the messages by a minute and have them work, but does it work for anybody else?  


Desired result:  schedule two family bells for two different rooms / speakers at the same time and have them both announce successfully.

91,googlehome,if7rra,t3_if7rra,Google home not responding,"Hey, for the last weeks I have had some problems with my nest mini. Every night about 2:00am it would loose connection and when I said the wake words it would just tell me to connect it in the google home app. I tried to factory reset it and that worked for a couple of days but then the usual problem just kept on going. When I tried to reset it a couple of days ago something strange happened. Now none of the lights on the nest mini are working and it is not responding when I say the wake words. The only think that works are the volume buttons. I can tap the sides and hear the sound of the volume going down or up, but not any lights. Does anybody know how to help?",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if7rra/google_home_not_responding/,andgro1,1598205421.0

93,googlehome,if7cod,t3_if7cod,Controlling the slideshow order on a Google Nest Hub.,"Hey everyone, I have a question and I was hoping someone could help me. 

We've a nest hub in our kitchen, which usually plays a slideshow of photos. We've 1 shared album where we put all our photos in, which has about 170 photos in it now. But for some reason the nest hub shows only a part of all these photos.

I know that there's a setting that excludes low quality photos, but I should have that turned off, so it should show all the photos in the album. But the hub usually shows only a handful of the same photos, with once in a while a new photo, and that's it.

I'd like to know if it's possible to control the slideshow order on the nest hub, so I could set it to show oldest to newest photos, instead of the random mode it's set to now.",3,Help,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if7cod/controlling_the_slideshow_order_on_a_google_nest/,Yusunoha,1598204110.0

95,googlehome,if6605,t3_if6605,Nest Wifi Nightmare,"I wanted to share my story, hopefully you will not make the same mistake as me.

Since the pandemic, my wife and I have been working from home.  We decided now is the best time to upgrade our wifi.  We bought a Nest Wifi Router with 2 Wifi points for \~$350.  

Setup was a breeze and having the wifi points as speakers is brilliant.  I was recommending all my co-workers to invest in one as well. 

Last week we started having issues with the router dropping internet connection every 5 minutes.  I assumed it was our ISP (comcast) or the modem.  We replaced the modem, and had a comcast service tech come to our house to diagnose the issue.  The service was still working when we plugged in the old wifi router so that pointed us to the Nest Router being the culprit.   So we tried hardwiring into the router, and still had issues!

After 4 hours of chatting with the google customer service they decided the router should be replaced.  I sent them all the critical information but they refused to process the replacement.  They required an itemized receipt from the purchase.   I had purchased the router and wifi kit about a month ago, so the receipt was long gone.   They said there is absolutely no way for the replacement to proceed without it.  The google rep asked if I could go back to best buy and ask them to re-print a receipt for me.

So here I am, trying to get best buy to go against their policy and reprint a receipt for me.  I have wasted (between comcast, the modem and Google) 8+ hours simply trying to get the product to function.",2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if6605/nest_wifi_nightmare/,Bensonian,1598200162.0
96,googlehome,if5pnr,t3_if5pnr,Letting my child control her own Spotify account with Google Home mini voice,"This has been talked about in just about every corner of the help web, and yet...I'm still stuck. How do I get my child's voice to control her Spotify account instead of mine?

We have a single Google Home Mini, and a Spotify family plan. I'm set up to control my Spotify account with my voice, my wife with hers, my older child (6) with hers. And for my younger kid (4), I've set up a child account successfully and done the Assistant voice recognition for her successfully. But I can't get that last piece where I specify that Spotify is the default music program and then link it to her Spotify account.

With my older kid, I had set up a standard Google account years ago and then turned it into a managed kid account recently. I then got a screen-busted iPhone to be ""her"" phone, signed her in to Google Home and was able to link Spotify. But with the younger child, I had set her account up in the Family Link app, which I'm guessing is the issue. If I try to log her in to a Google Home account, it just...does nothing. I get an email saying that she was logged in and the list of thing that she's not able to do, but not specifically mentioning Google Home.

Is there any way to get this last bit to happen? I want to let her listen to Descendants to her heart's desire without polluting my library. My ""Discover Weekly"" is half Dove Cameron now!",1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/if5pnr/letting_my_child_control_her_own_spotify_account/,areseven,1598198615.0

I don't understand what the recent issue is that's causing it to stop everything. I am to the point that I'm going to unplug these and throw them in the trash.
