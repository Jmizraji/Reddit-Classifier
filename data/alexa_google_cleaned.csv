We have a small 1-bedroom apartment and it just seemed like the smart affordable solution. We were always pretty happy up until now with the rest of the GH products we purchased (we have 2 mini's, 1 chromecast ultra for the samsung TV and 1 chromecast audio for a Marshall Stanmore speaker).

As I saw online, you need a complicated setup to play from the TV without delay (connect from the TV optical to an analog converter, to a L/R splitter, to aux for both speakers).

My experience so far:

1. When playing anything on the TV not using the chromecast, the speakers have to be set to 100% and even then they're still kinda low.
2. This also means you have to mute the mic, otherwise whenever the assistant says something, the entire neighborhood can hear it. Which sucks, since now these are not smart speakers anymore.
3. In this set-up you cannot pair the 2 speakers to work as stereo pair (that will cause the delay issue with the TV). So when I play music I stream to the TV. This streams through the chromecast, so the volume is normal (very loud). I tried setting up routines to automatically set the volume down, but they almost never work.
4. Trying to combine the speakers to a speaker group and control the volume like that is also buggy: when the aux is playing music the speakers and group are unresponsive. when they do respond, changing the volume changes only one speaker and resets to a different value than was input.

googlehome,igh98w,t3_igh98w,School time! I need help with Family Bells and the Start the School Day feature.,"We have Google Home speakers in every room of the house.  So, these new school related features would work great for us, if I can get them working the way I need.  


First!  ""Start the school day"" command.  The Google Home device that hears the spoken command will play a school bell, simulate a busy school hallway sound, and rotate colors on the smart lights to simulate movement.  It's really cool!  BUT!  It will ONLY play the sounds on the speaker that heard the command.  I can't call it in a routine.  And, I can't get it to play on multiple speakers.   


Desired result:  call the command in a timed routine and have it play on all connected home devices.  


Second!  Family Bells.  Not that dissimilar to a routine that broadcasts a message to a specific speaker.  This feature was touted as helping keeping kids on track by sending alarms bundled with a message to a specific speaker.  It almost works perfectly, until multiple children need a timer at the same moment.  My kids Zoom meetings coincide, and Google will only play one of the scheduled bells on one of the speakers and ignore the rest.  I can offset one of the messages by a minute and have them work, but does it work for anybody else?  


Desired result:  schedule two family bells for two different rooms / speakers at the same time and have them both announce successfully. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, the family bells I can work around with routines, so that's more a curiosity if it's just me.  The simulated school sounds I would LOVE to get working though.

Upgraded my WiFi modem to a Nighthawk (bridged from AT&T AC WiFi gateway)

reconnected my Google home assistants and thermostat.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

Now I'd say the last week or so the home assistants and my phone assistant (pixel 3a) won't respond.

They'll blip, listen, then do nothing.
Reset, re-setup on 5G and 2.4 no change.
Re-trained voice model. No change.


I can view and change settings, adjust volume for them in the home app. Casting audio ""connects"" but routes audio thru my phone still.

googlehome,ifd2sq,t3_ifd2sq,Use a google home device for TV audio,"Hi,

Kinda new to all the domotics/ smart home stuff and I really like to command everything in my house through voice commands.

One problem I didn't find a clear solution yet is : Is it possible to use any google speakers products to replace (or go along) my old soundbar (JBL SB250) to play my TV (Samsung 6 series) audio ? 

My TV is currently plugged into the soundbar through an optic cable, and the soundbar also has an usb port.

I'm considering buying either a Google Home Max or the [new Google Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8MVREwkJIM) to do that, and if they are able to replace my soundbar (don't take into account sound quality) , will I need a special converter to do so ?

Setup was a breeze and having the wifi points as speakers is brilliant.  I was recommending all my co-workers to invest in one as well.

The service was still working when we plugged in the old wifi router so that pointed us to the Nest Router being the culprit.   So we tried hardwiring into the router, and still had issues!

I then got a screen-busted iPhone to be ""her"" phone, signed her in to Google Home and was able to link Spotify. But with the younger child, I had set her account up in the Family Link app, which I'm guessing is the issue. If I try to log her in to a Google Home account, it just...does nothing. I get an email saying that she was logged in and the list of thing that she's not able to do, but not specifically mentioning Google Home.

Is there any way to get this last bit to happen? I want to let her listen to Descendants to her heart's desire without polluting my library. My ""Discover Weekly"" is half Dove Cameron now!"

I have a Google Nest Mini connected to my Google home, and I was wondering if you could help me, since I can’t find anything on Google support. 

Three times I received emails about someone requested an invitation to join my home, and it’s people I don’t know.

I think my google home is ‘bricked’ as one might say. I’m not 100% tech savvy. Plus note, I don’t trust myself to open up the machine. Anyways, one day my home works and the next— Nope. 

First, when I spoke to it, it says ‘your google home isn’t set up yet’, so I attempted to reconnect. I even factory reset. Nothing worked. Then it said, ‘unable to play music at this time’. So, I’ve given up at this point. I messaged Google themselves, and they’ve given me multiple solutions in which I’ve tried as well as online solutions- leaving it plugged in for 24 hours, unplugged for days, hitting the factory reset, reconnect to a different email, unplugging it 10 times, turning off the mic for a few minutes, etc. 

Is anyone else having this problem? I don’t have any other homes in my house, and I’m the sole controller. Spotify is the only thing connected too. The four white lights dim in and out, and that’s it. Keep in mind, I live in Canada, and even Google said that a replacement is not going to happen right now, especially if some are faulty. Nobody I personally know has also had this problem. 

Does anyone have any solutions on what I should do besides ditch it and/or buy a new one? (Just saying, but I probably won’t do that.) All I do is use it for music and the occasional alarm. I’ve had this since the end of 2018 too.

YouTube Music have 2 options same with Google Play Music.

You can use the free version and you can also subscribed to the membership.

To be honest, Google Nest mini is a separate team than us. So I'm not sure how their process is. But YouTube Music is compatible with the Google Nest Mini device. So it should work since you have uploaded songs on it.

Here are some screenshots of my routine: [https://imgur.com/a/zWn5DNA](https://imgur.com/a/zWn5DNA)

I have a google home hub max that I bought for my apartment on campus. My university does have a network for smart devices however they need to approve each individual MAC address. I sent them an email and got my address on the list... Now the problem

They will not add my phone to the ""BYOD"" network because it can access the splash page for the main wifi network. So how can I set up my google home without having to connect my phone to the BYOD network as well?

I can easily trigger the 'Sorry that device has not been set up yet' (or similar, my GH speaks German) by having my TV on, then playing a song on e.g. spotify on my phone, then triggering assistant on my phone and saying 'turn the TV off' -> TV does not turn off and I get the above message.
However, when I stop spotify and say the same thing, it works.
It's the same with YouTube and also when it is not my phone playing spotify/YouTube, but any Mini / Nest Hub and I ask them to turn on or off the TV...

So summarized: Whenever I tell an assistant (on phone, Mini, Nest Mini, Nest Hub) to turn the TV on or off, WHILE on the device bringing up the assistant something is playing (Spotify, YouTube), it does not perform the action but instead tells me the message above.

googlehome,ibgrpr,t3_ibgrpr,"""can not connect to the internet"" then ""this device is not set up yet..."" with Google Home and Mini on wifi without a password and cast firmware 1.49.218411 - SOLUTION sort of","""cast firmware **1.49.218411**"" issue that is happening with the Google Home and Mini(first gen devices, but not the newer 'Nest' versions) running on **unsecured networks**; and it gets kinda confusing because others might have kinda similar issues from other causes, but here the fix Google is recommending is that you set a password to access your wifi network and then rerun setup

the symptoms of this particular problem are

1. no password for wifi access
2. Google devices were working fine then suddenly they say ""can not connect to the internet""
3. older 1st gen Google Home and Mini that have recently updated to cast firmware 1.49.218411
4. if you try removing the devices from the app then reinstalling they will get to the last step where they connect to wifi and 'something went wrong' and they will further just respond with ""this device is not set up yet...""
5. if you do a 'factory reset', right before the final step the device might 'install an update', however the 'factory reset' does not clear the cast firmware nor reinstall a new one or the bad firmware
6. you might be able to still see the devices listed as connected to your wifi router just fine; and if you can still find them in your app, click 'settings' for them and scroll down to the bottom to check if they are running cast firmware 1.49.218411
7. you need to set a password on your wifi network these devices use, then they should work with cast firmware 1.49.218411 
8. log into your wifi router(usually something like  [http://192.168.1.1/Login.html](http://192.168.1.1/Login.html) ) and reconfigure it for password, then you will also have to give that password to all the other devices that use that wifi

really sucks that Google is still pushing out the 1.49.218411 update even tho they have gotten many reports for at least a month now that it has caused a huge problem for people that don't need to password protect their wifi ...I'm sure there are a lot of people out there with older Google Homes and Minis that just stopped using them - or have spent hours with tech support, which they just try to make it seem like we have done something wrong and they want us to painfully go thru all these basic steps over and over again - hopefully now they at least are asking if we have an unsecured wifi and to check for ***their*** bad cast firmware 1.49.218411 update

the symptoms of this particular problem are

1. no password for wifi access
2. Google devices were working fine then suddenly they say ""can not connect to the internet""
3. older 1st gen Google Home and Mini that have recently updated to cast firmware 1.49.218411
4. if you try removing the devices from the app then reinstalling they will get to the last step where they connect to wifi and 'something went wrong' and they will further just respond with ""this device is not set up yet...""
5. if you do a 'factory reset', right before the final step the device might 'install an update', however the 'factory reset' does not clear the cast firmware nor reinstall a new one or the bad firmware
6. you might be able to still see the devices listed as connected to your wifi router just fine; and if you can still find them in your app, click 'settings' for them and scroll down to the bottom to check if they are running cast firmware 1.49.218411
7. you need to set a password on your wifi network these devices use, then they should work with cast firmware 1.49.218411 
8. log into your wifi router(usually something like  [http://192.168.1.1/Login.html](http://192.168.1.1/Login.html) ) and reconfigure it for password, then you will also have to give that password to all the other devices that use that wifi

googlehome,i9thp4,t3_i9thp4,Gapless is over on Google Home,"""Hey Google, play Dark Side of the Moon""

Ever listen to that album without gapless playback? Sucks doesn't it? The YTM fiasco has me scrambling for a replacement music service (I'm on the free trial for pretty much all of them) and I just realized something horrible. GPM is the only app that can perform gapless playback on Google speakers. YTM can't do it. Spotify can't do it. Apple music can't do it. I can't get Deezer to link to my Home account so I don't know if they can do it. With the death of GPM just around the corner, the ability to listen to albums like Sgt. Pepper on Home/Nest speakers without obnoxious gaps between songs is ending. no one else (including Google themselves) can do it!

I bought an Echo Dot to experiment with and Spotify, Amazon Music and Apple Music can all perform gapless playback on it, no problem.

I just want to come home from work, put my feet up and tell my assistant to play my favorite records and listen to them as the artists and producers intended. I've had that ability for years and soon it will be gone. Do I really have to replace all my speakers to get this very simple ability back? All the major streaming services can deliver gapless playback on Echo devices, why not Home/Nest? Finding a new service is one thing, replacing all my hardware is another. The only workaround I've found is mirroring via the Home app but that kinda defeats the purpose of having a digital assistant who responds to voice commands don't you think? Might as well go back to Bluetooth at that point.

Does anyone here have any insights into this? My house is decked out with Google speakers, I'd hate to replace them but they're really of no use to me if I can't enjoy the music that they deliver. At first I thought the forced move to YTM was obnoxious, but now it's going to get really expensive if this isn't sorted out.

googlehome,i8mhwd,t3_i8mhwd,Nest Hello won't connect with app after moving to new WiFi router.,"Not sure whether I should post in here or r/nest.

I've had a nest hello working fine for six months. Today I changed broadband provider and had to set everything up with the new WiFi.

The nest hello stubbornly refuses to work. It connects to the WiFi but I just can't get it to connect to the nest app or show up in the GH app. 

After initially changing the WiFi I had the steady blue circle, but the image wouldn't load. Neither would any of the history.

After a lot of messing about, I deleted it from the nest app and eventually did a factory reset (I had to delete and reinstall the nest thermostat to get it to work also, although it didn't need a factory reset.) and fresh install. It gets as far as accepting the WiFi password but as it tries to register with nest, it chimes and flashes a yellow circle twice, finally failing with the error code NC009 (15.5).

I've logged into the WiFi router as admin (although it's all a bit beyond me) and can see that the nest hello has been assigned a Mac address, so I just can't figure out what's wrong with it. I've even tried an installation with the firewall disabled and the Upnp security disabled. It still results in the same error code.

This is really frustrating. Anyone got any ideas? I'm in the UK and it's a BT Smarthub2.



One final bit of information.

We've had a hell of a lightning strike, very close to the house and I could swear that there was a small spark from behind the router, but there's no sign of any evidence of arcing and absolutely everything else (GH speakers, Nest thermostat, Tradfri lights, Harmony hub), are working fine, so this is probably a red herring.

The nest hello stubbornly refuses to work. It connects to the WiFi but I just can't get it to connect to the nest app or show up in the GH app. 

After initially changing the WiFi I had the steady blue circle, but the image wouldn't load. Neither would any of the history.

After a lot of messing about, I deleted it from the nest app and eventually did a factory reset (I had to delete and reinstall the nest thermostat to get it to work also, although it didn't need a factory reset.) and fresh install. It gets as far as accepting the WiFi password but as it tries to register with nest, it chimes and flashes a yellow circle twice, finally failing with the error code NC009 (15.5).

I've logged into the WiFi router as admin (although it's all a bit beyond me) and can see that the nest hello has been assigned a Mac address, so I just can't figure out what's wrong with it. I've even tried an installation with the firewall disabled and the Upnp security disabled. It still results in the same error code.

This is really frustrating. Anyone got any ideas? I'm in the UK and it's a BT Smarthub2.



One final bit of information.

We've had a hell of a lightning strike, very close to the house and I could swear that there was a small spark from behind the router, but there's no sign of any evidence of arcing and absolutely everything else (GH speakers, Nest thermostat, Tradfri lights, Harmony hub), are working fine, so this is probably a red herring.

**UPDATE**

Thanks to u/ronchilling for his timely post on r/nest.

If anyone else is having similar problems, try reinstalling the Nest app. It worked like a charm for me."

Our router is on the mantle in the front of the house.  This is where the Ethernet jack is, and where we tend to spend most of our gaming/TV/hosting time.  The router is powerful enough to get decent signal to the back of the house.  We can stream Netflix, etc no problem.

We're considering buying a two pack of Nest wifi routers, but I'm not sure I know the technology well enough to be confident they'd help.  Are they just wifi routers?  Do they need to be hooked up to the Ethernet?  Or are they capable of like, absorbing and amplifying the existing wifi signal?

I'm a huge fan of Google Home and we have tons of devices in the Google Home infrastructure (Home minis, Chromecasts, Pixel phone etc).  So I'm hoping this is the answer to our problem, but I wanted to check with folks in the know before I commit.

googlehome,i7cmol,t3_i7cmol,"Google Nest Hub, Hubitat & Inovelli Light Switches","Hey folks! I'm moving from a smart-tech-free studio apartment into my first condo and am looking into setting up a smart home network in my new home. I've been researching and slowly acquiring items I'd like to add as they go on sale while I wait for move-in day. I've already decided (for various reasons) on Google Assistant as my voice assistant and Hubitat Elevation as my hub. I'm now researching the best ways to start establishing a good base for my smart home usage... once I recoup from the closing costs. :)

I'm currently researching light switches, with the intent on eventually replacing all the light switches with a single brand for a consistent look and (hopefully) easier customer service if there are any issues. I've been bouncing between a few different choices, but I quite like the [Inovelli](https://inovelli.com/) brand of light switches. I'm specifically looking at using Red series dimmer switches for most switches, dipping into Red On/Off or Red Fan + Light as needed, and depending on the number of switches using Black Dimmers or Black On/Offs for closets and other rarely-used areas.

However, one thing I'm having a hard time looking into is how Google Assistant would interact with the Inovelli switches. I understand that Hubitat will allow me to control the switches with voice commands regardless, but ideally I'd like to be able to use my Hub to control lights throughout the condo as well, I naturally gravitate to touch controls when I have options and all the videos make controlling lights through the hub pretty slick. Am I correct though, that since Inovelli does not have the ""Works With Google"" distinction, this would not be possible? It's a minor thing, but that may drive me towards Caséta instead, if it has the functionality with the Google Nest Hub. (Otherwise, I prefer the look of the Inovelli lights and the many options for scene controls with multi-presses.)

googlehome,i70i0k,t3_i70i0k,I've made a Tool to filter Gmails and Trigger a IFTTT notification," I've made a very simple Google Script that will check for the arrival of any specified Gmail and then trigger any IFTTT service, like turn on a light or whatever. It doesn't need any other software or connections and only takes a few minutes to set up.

You can [find it here](https://script.google.com/d/1Y2wUrpTTZAFV7UcSsCl9bKP0a_Kv6prmIXgZqQdSohKj3-95AUrqwoPM/edit?usp=sharing) and the instructions are included. This is how it works:

* First you add the Script to your own Google Apps Scripts, add your webhook key and save it.
* Then create a Gmail 'Filter' to label the specific emails you want to trigger IFTTT.
* When the script runs it'll detect the emails, send a webhook event, and remove the trigger label.

You can use it to change a light colour, or flash a light. Or you could even use it to unlock a door or open the garage with an email, or write to a spreadsheet or anything with IFTTT you can think of.

It's very simple, so you can easily read it and see it's safe to use even if you don't code. It won't mess with your emails, all it will do is add the extra label on arrival, and then remove it again when the webhook is sent. To remove it just delete the Script.

It adds the number of labelled emails with the webhook just in case you want to write to a spreadsheet - the number will appear. You can edit the name of the label and can also inhibit the removal of the label. (That's useful as you could for example, set a LIFX light to 'breathe' continually and it will revert automatically to the original settings when the email is deleted or label removed.)

It doesn't need any other software or connections and only takes a few minutes to set up.

You can [find it here](https://script.google.com/d/1Y2wUrpTTZAFV7UcSsCl9bKP0a_Kv6prmIXgZqQdSohKj3-95AUrqwoPM/edit?usp=sharing) and the instructions are included. This is how it works:

* First you add the Script to your own Google Apps Scripts, add your webhook key and save it.
* Then create a Gmail 'Filter' to label the specific emails you want to trigger IFTTT.
* When the script runs it'll detect the emails, send a webhook event, and remove the trigger label.

Any other ideas welcome!"

Mon, Jun 29, 3:10 PM to googlehome-support Hi. ISP is Verizon with a FiOS router provided by them.  
All other Google speakers in the house work fine and do not disconnect from WiFi. These are all Google Home Mini's.  
The problem of the Google Home Max disconnecting from WiFi is widely reported in support pages on the web, so I don't think it is related to any equipment in my house.  
Thanks.

My apologies, I was not able to get back to you right away. I'm sorry to hear that you're having an issue with your Google Home Max. We'll be needing additional details to further investigate. We'll be needing the firmware of your Home Max. Here's how to check:**Find the current firmware version**

1. Open the Google Home app 📷.
2. Tap your device 📷 Settings 📷.
3. Scroll to the bottom and look for Cast firmware version: X.XXX.XXXXX.

Tue, Jun 30, 5:40 PM to googlehome-support Hi. The firmware version is:  
1.46.195690  
Just to explain further: this is a two-fold problem. The Max frequently disconnects from WiFi between uses. It reconnects (shows up as connected in Google Home app) if I unplug it and then plug it back in.   
The second problem is, often after playing for a half hour or so (whether from Spotify or Google Podcasts, for example), the sound completely degrades to something that resembles “sampling”. I could make a memo recording of it with my phone, if you like.   
All of this only happens on the Max. The Mini’s all work fine. Again, Max is very close to the WiFi router — about 12 feet.   
Thanks!  
\------------------------  
Tue, Jun 30, 7:13 PM to googlehome-support Also interesting: When the Max has disconnected itself from WiFi, if I say “Hey Google, play music on Spotify”, it will play music. But it still doesn’t show up as connected to WiFi in the Google Home app. If the Max is playing music this way, and I go into Spotify and select my Group of “All Speakers”, music starts playing on the Google Home Mini’s in other parts of the house, but the Max gives a message that it has stopped playing because “your Spotify account is already in use”.   
Thanks.

Sat, Jul 4, 5:46 PM to googlehome-support I followed your instructions and sent feedback. Also, attached is ascreenshot of the Google Home app after the Google Home Max has not been used for a couple of hours.  
More information:  
If I say “play music on Spotify“, the Google home Max says “sorry, I’m not connected to the Internet“. However, if I say “hey google, good morning“, it plays my name, the current weather, my schedule, and the current headlines. So it’s clearly connected to Wi-Fi and the Internet, but there’s a glitch somewhere. 

 \------------------------------  
Sat, Jul 4, 6:03 PM to googlehome-support Correction: If I say, Hey google, play music on Spotify”, it will! But it STILL shows up as not connected to the internet, and I can’t control the Max from the Google Home app. And I can’t play music from the Max + google home Mini speakers (in other rooms) simultaneously. Very strange. If I unplug and replug the Max, it shows as connected to WiFi once again.   
\-------------------------------  
Sat, Jul 4, 6:46 PM to googlehome-support Second problem — related??? Every 15 minutes or so (unpredictable) the sound deteriorates to almost nothing (listen to attached recording), and then recovers on its own a few minutes later.

I don't listen to music often enough to warrant paying for a streaming service and free versions don't really cater for my tastes (which tend to hover around the 80s).

The assistant seemed to lose the ability to play music from my library a while back and I just assumed it was the usual ""Google must have broken something again""; until yesterday, when my wife announced she was ""in the mood for a bit of White snake"". There doesn't seem to be any way to purchase music through Google Play Music anymore and apparently it is being rolled into YouTube Music.

I forgot to mention that YouTube Music won't even let you cast to a GH device unless you sign up for their ""Premium"" service.

The purchased music is also compatible with third party apps like Poweramp...... I'm wondering wether I can ask Google assistant to play specific tracks from Poweramp as a workaround for requesting music via voice command?

My daughter, who is about to turn 12 however, is very interested in setting up her bedroom as a smart bedroom. My issue is that ill probably need to do it with her and I'm not sure where to start so I'm hoping I can ask a few questions here (and please forgive me if they're stupid questions):

1. Is it possible to set up just one room or should I buy the mesh and set it up across the whole house?
2. What is the most appropriate set up for a teenagers room? She wants to be able to play music and get a smart bulb to control the lights, maybe some other minor stuff as she figures it out.
3. Her bedroom, and her sisters, don't get internet. They are too far away from the modem to get WiFi. Its strong throughout most of our house except for their two bedrooms at the back of the house. Is this an issue? If so, what is recommended?
4. In general, what is the best way to set this all up? Her birthday is coming up and I think this would be a great gift for her, but I don't want her disappointed if I've got the wrong thing and it doesn't end up working.

googlehome,i4rq4t,t3_i4rq4t,Looking for a way to control an IR-operated ceiling fan through Google Assistant,"Hello Everyone

I'm currently in the process of trying to improve my laziness by making my house as smart as possible.Recently we purchased 3 ceiling fans (1 for each of the bedrooms), which are controlled through an IR remote.To convert these into smart devices, I purchased a Tuya Smarthome compatible IR blaster which should be compatible with 99,99% of all devices, and in the rare case it isn't, you should be able to create a custom ""DIY"" remote using the original one to learn the IR commands.

Just my luck, I'm part of the 0,01%...Turns out to create a DIY remote in the Smarthome app, which identifies as a fan, you need to create a DIY fan, after which you teach it the IR commands.Unfortunately, this DIY remote always expects:

1. 1 button to toggle the fan's power
2. 1 button to adjust the fan's speed
3. 1 button to adjust the direction

Unfortunately, my fan uses 4 buttons for just the first 2 options.

1. Turn fan Off
2. Turn fan speed to low
3. Turn fan speed to medium

I'm currently in the process of trying to improve my laziness by making my house as smart as possible.Recently we purchased 3 ceiling fans (1 for each of the bedrooms), which are controlled through an IR remote.To convert these into smart devices, I purchased a Tuya Smarthome compatible IR blaster which should be compatible with 99,99% of all devices, and in the rare case it isn't, you should be able to create a custom ""DIY"" remote using the original one to learn the IR commands.

Just my luck, I'm part of the 0,01%...Turns out to create a DIY remote in the Smarthome app, which identifies as a fan, you need to create a DIY fan, after which you teach it the IR commands.Unfortunately, this DIY remote always expects:

1. 1 button to toggle the fan's power
2. 1 button to adjust the fan's speed
3. 1 button to adjust the direction

Unfortunately, my fan uses 4 buttons for just the first 2 options.

1. Turn fan Off
2. Turn fan speed to low
3. Turn fan speed to medium
4. Turn fan speed to high

When buttons 2-4 are pressed, these also start the motor when it's stopped.

So I own 2 Nest GHM set up with voice recognition for my parents and me.
But it has a problem with my moms voice..
She has like a 3% succes rate of getting the device to listen when she says the activation word..
97% the device won’t start listening..

I tried re-enabling voice match, and it didn’t help.
And when the device activates on the hot word and she asks her name, the device tells my dads name..

If I activate it, the device will perfectly understand the question my mom asks, so it’s not her voice?

As per the title my issue is with a Hue Bluetooth bulb. I bought one yesterday and set it up in Google Home without issue. This evening however suddenly I couldn't change the color or brightness any longer. I thought that setting up the bulb again would solve that problem; boy was I wrong!

I initially thought something might be wrong with the bulb so I downloaded the Hue app and it paired no problem.

I searched a bit online and have tried basically everything multiple times: I've done a factory reset of the bulb from the app. Uninstalled the Hue app. Cleared the cache of the Home app, moved the speaker in question closer to the light. Until now the Home app doesn't detect the bulb.

For some reason the Google Home, 2 Minis, and 1 Chromecast have stopped working on my network.

I tried to fully reset the devices, reset my entire router (even loaded Merlin on my Asus AC3100), made sure 'Airtime Fairness' was disabled and other common settings that Merlin configures for compatibility. I have taken all these devices to a friend's house who has an Eero mesh network and they all work over there.

What else can I try or do to make these devices work at my home again?

Thanks!"
googlehome,i36w0r,t3_i36w0r,Routines not working with MyQ garage door,"So kind of a strange issue - if i say the command direcly ""ask MyQ if the garage door is open"" (or closed) it will work as expected and connect to myq and give the status of the door.

However, if I setup a routine that says the same exact text - google assistant just pulls up a blank page.  Occasionally, it looks like there is some text there, but it scrolls up the screen so fast it can't be read and can't be scrolled/all i see is a blank page, no voice, no text other than ""customize is the garage door open routine""

I've setup this exact routine in the past and it's worked, and i've tried deleting/re-creating the routine, as well as unsubscribing/resubscribing to the google assistant service through myq.  Seems to be more of a google assistant issue with the routine specifically as the straight up voice command works without issue.

Have rebooted phone and made sure everything is up to date.  Pixel 4 XL with android 10 if that helps.  This has been driving me crazy for a few hours.  Thanks in advance, Reddit family :)

I recently moved and so I setup a new ""home"" through the Google Home App. I have 6 Philips Hue lights that worked perfectly in the previous home and were all linked. Once I moved, I first deleted the old home (I did not remove the devices first as I didn't think that was a necessary step).

Now, the Philips Hue app works and I have the new rooms setup where I can turn the lights on or off, however, the Google Home app does not work. A few things are happening:

\- First, Philips Hue is able to link to the Google Home app 

\- The Google Home app pulls in the lights from Philips Hue, two of the lights are placed in the correct rooms (Kitchen & Bedroom) - these two lights do not work via voice command and I cannot turn them on via the app either. The other 4 lights are in a ""Linked to You"" box saying that they are not in the home. 

\- When I attempt to add a light to a room it first asks to ""Choose a Home"", so I choose the new home. It confirms that it has been moved into the new home. Then I click ""Move Device"" which allows me to select a room, which I do... But then I get an error message ""There was a problem communicating with Google. Please wait a few moments"". This has been going on for a few days now, so I don't think that that is the problem.

\- The lights also show up as ""Not Responding"", when I try to reconnect the Hue account to each individual light - they show as though they are responding, but no commands work, and when I attempt to add to a room they go back to the not responding phase. 

\- I have tried unlinking the apps, reconnecting, so on and so forth including factory resetting the Philips Hue hub and resetting. I have used the ""Okay Google, Sync Devices"" command to no avail. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the Home app as well.

The recordings happen between 1am to 6am with one or two notifications from 12am, 8am, 11pm.

I'm within the Google Home eco-system and getting really frustrated. Currently I have the following setup:

* 1x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the office
* 2x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Kitchen
* 1x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Bathroom
* 2x Nest Mini 2nd Gen in the Bedroom (paired)
* 1x Chromecast Audio hooked up to my Living Room Speakers

Now to the issues:

1. If I'm asking google to play music for the first time and request the music to play on my speaker group which includes ALL the speakers, it's a total hit or miss. 80% of the time it never works. 
2. However, if I ask google to play music, and let it play on the speaker I requested it on, it will play -- and then I can immediately ask Google to play it on my speaker group and voila, works like magic. Works almost 100% of the time. What the fuck?
3. Then sometimes, when I'm asking Google to play some music, it keeps asking me ""Would you still like that to play on Bedroom Pair"". It's literally the most annoying thing ever and ridiculous. It also happens to always do that on the most random times. How can I get google to never ask me that question ever again? 
   1. Occasionally, it will ask me ""Do you still want to play that on everywhere (my speaker group) and if I say yes -- it does nothing. Literally nothing. It just twinkles some dots and goes away. Uh, okay. 

I have other issues with the eco-system similar to everyone else, such as crappy GUI, it getting stupider and me having to yell, and just stupid random stuff. However, I like to listen to alot of music and one of the reasons I got myself into the eco-system was for a smart home/multi-room audio setup. The implementation is just horrid. I literally have a full wi-fi mesh system setup -- and I read that  Chromecast Audios can cause some issues due to its connectivity and I even put one of my mesh satellite systems right next to the chromecast but it still works like junk.

googlehome,i0z53a,t3_i0z53a,Broken Google Home Max PCB,"I noticed the other day that my Google Home Max was not working anymore and did some looking around. After trying to do various factory resets and using different outlets, I realized it wasn't getting power. So I took it apart and checked the voltage in and out of the power supply/converter, which was working great. I looked in  closer and found two burnt out components on the mother board, tried to contact google for help but since its out of warranty they pretty much told me to pound sand.

&#x200B;

Does anyone know where I can get a replacement mother board or where I can get these two components to try and re solder them on? Or if you have any ideas on how I can use this still.

# Timers and Utilities for Google Assistant and IFTTT

It’s very quick to set up, maybe only ten or twenty minutes if you can use a mouse and can cut and paste. If you make sure you have the IFTTT Webhook service already activated, & Google Assistant already connected in your IFTTT account, it should be fairly easy, and it needs no other logins or any extra software. The different functions are split into separate threaded posts to make it easy to follow and then add different parts as needed. The only part you have to actually set-up is Timer-1. The other functions are enabled by simply adding extra applets once you have got that first one working.

**Reasons why it’s a good method:**

* It’s all under your own control, using just your accounts at IFTTT and Google. There are no other apps or any software to install, no external 3rd party API links, or any local hardware to maintain so it should be reliable too.
* It’s very secure, you could even share device activation links (using separate scripts) without exposing your IFTTT key. You already have Google and IFTTT accounts so there’s nothing more you need and nowhere else you need to login. Google also regulates the permissions that any script is allowed, so it's safe.
* It’s simple. Once you've set it up, every function is by voice control. You don't really need to go back to the script for anything, just set it up and forget it. Your voice timers will just work with whatever timed request you say. And there is no app to install or setup & config files to backup, so you can modify your setup from any computer or phone. A simple voice timer to control ALL your devices needs only a single applet, and then the event triggers for each device take only seconds to set up. 
* It’s useful and versatile and it doesn’t have to be just about lights & switches, you can use it to control any IFTTT-THAT service, or pull in API data from elsewhere to make events conditional. You can also set up 'hard coded' applets (GA or Alexa) with simple quick voice commands for frequently repeated timers. You can even trigger timers using Tasker or any service that can send a webhook.",3,1.0,0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/i0nd6j/easy_timers_and_utilities_for_google_assistant/,Godberd,2020-07-30 07:50:54,0,"Easy Timers and Utilities for Google Assistant and IFTTT

I made the mistake of integrating with google home, which was seemless and automatic going in - super easy!  However, I have no idea why anyone would think this was a good idea.  It got me absolutely nothing in terms of features or functionality or 'smart home', and created a ton of problems.  First of all, it adds a layer of indirection and obfuscation on top of the nest interface, with less functionality, which is just dumb and annoying.  Next, it busted my wife's access to nest because she didn't want to mess with google home (smart woman).  Note: If this were designed and implemented properly, it would be ANOTHER interface to the nest ecosystem via google home.  That way, if you didnt like it - you could just access it via your nest account.  That is what I insanely thought they had done, in which case my wife could have still accessed everything. Sadly, that is now how they built it.  And my wife was locked out of nest unless I added her to google home.  Which means she couldnt see the baby cam.  So I reluctantly added her to google home, against her wishes, which would clear it all up, right?  Nope... it allowed her access to the thermostat, but none of the cameras.  None of the cameras got added automatically for her access and it wants me to re-add them.  It wants me to go into her nest app (not google home) and add all 10 cameras individually all over again.  Some of these are mounted high up outside.  So... apparently the brilliant folks at google home didnt bother gather the full nest config (thermo, cameras, etc) - or let it be accessible by users added to google home?  Oh yeah..  also, I tried removing the nest account from google home, and re-adding it.  Doesnt help.  Also - once you've done this, the google password overrides your previous login, so there is no way to 'go back'.  

What a great way to take a perfectly good product and completely f\*\*\* it up.  I hope someone from google home is reading this.  You are technical imbeciles.  

The only 'solution' that I have found, for this exact problem, is that someone basically rebuilt their system by removing it from google home, creating a new nest account, re setup the nest with that account, and and re-added all of the devices.  I'm likeliy going to have to do that anyway because I'll need to re-add all of the cameras for my wife's phone since google home didnt migrate them.

We have a Google family account, so it's not an issue with too many devices at once. There's no announcement like we used to get before upgrading (something like: Google can no longer play music because it is being used on another device). It just stops. 

It seems completely random as well. Sometimes we're not using other devices. 

I typically start it by asking the speaker to play the track I want. If I notice that it has stopped and she's still asleep, I go through this annoying process of starting it back up using the other devices in my house so as not to disturb her. 

I just want my things to work correctly. Help!"

alexa,ie0m98,t3_ie0m98,Mymedia for Alexa does not work with Echo 8 when used with a default Sonos speaker,"
Please find here under the description of the issue I have with the incorrect behavior of the app Mymedia for Alexa used in an Amazon Echo 8 configured with a default Sonos system:
Description here under is based on an Echo 8 with my Sonos Port but is also valid with any of my Sonos equipments ( I have a PLAYBAR + bass + 2 Sonos 1, a Sonos 5, and a Sonos 3)

First of all a quick sum up of my configuration:
I use the last version of mymedia inside a docker of my Synology NAS
The version is currently 1.3.133.0
All my music is also in the NAS and except a very few exceptions uses the m4a format
I have a Amazon echo 8 configured to use a SONOS PORT as the default speaker system. 
I also have a Amazon Firestick 4 K configured to use the HDMI in pasthrough toward the TV set linked to a SONOS PLAYBAR via optical.

Both systems Echo/Port and Firestick/TV/PLAYBAR don’t work 
“Don’t work” means that when I ask to play an album, I have the first track only of the album, the picture of the album only a few seconds on the screen then picture goes away . 
Please note that even long time after I can say “Alexa suivant” ( means Next) and it plays the next ones. So it seems some process is hung.

On the contrary when I use Alexa with the IPhone ( alone), IPad (alone) or the embedded Alexa of my OLED LG TV ( linked through optical cable to the SONOS PLAYBAR, it works
“It works” means that I have the picture of the album during all the time and system changes itself track to next tracks as it should work.
Please note that some times it plays 2 times the same first track of the album then stops.

I have a contact with the develop team of mymedia for Alexa and their analysis thanks to traces I sent them is that this issue is on the Sonos side that obviously requests inconsistent to play several times the same track.
I cannot understand all their explanations but they asked me that they should be very happy to enter in contact with your team for fixing that issue .
Finally please not that Mymedia for Alexa is a very interesting program to use with Alexa as in France Amazon does not provide neither the Plex support or the Audio station skill

For their hue to match, I have to set different colours. For instance if I set them all to cyan, some are more blue and some are more green.

I know Alexa has a large set of available colours to choose from when Im just yelling at her to set a colour, but I was unable to set a routine using those more detailed colour choices.

alexa,ic0266,t3_ic0266,Looking for feedback on my dissertation,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I am a Portuguese university student, currently working on my Master's thesis dissertation. As part of my dissertation, I had to create a natural language interaction for an existing autonomous agent framework, and I used the Alexa Skills Kit to do that.

&#x200B;

For the past months I have worked on and developed this skill that allows you to communicate with the Virtual Suspect agent framework, which is an autonomous agent that inhabits the role of a suspect in the context of a police interrogation. Now I am looking for people to test the skill, so I can get some feedback and finish my dissertation. If this sounds interesting to you, or you would just like to help me out, here's what I need you to do:

&#x200B;

1) Before you open the skill, please read this document containing information about the case that you need to know in order to interrogate the Virtual Suspect, as well as some guidelines on how to interact with him: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU\_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJacn3LzyqZIMrFGVvU_h4kRa62bkk8tYrMbe89nRzs/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

2) Enable the Virtual Suspect Demo skill, which can be found at: [https://www.amazon.com/IST\_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/](https://www.amazon.com/IST_Palhas-Virtual-Suspect-Demo/dp/B08FZMVS7H/)

2a) You can open the skill by saying ""Alexa open Virtual Suspect"" and then you'll be placed in a dialogue with the agent and you can ask him questions about the case directly. There is no endpoint, you can ask him whatever questions you want and finish whenever you want, the session will be maintained until you decide to end the interaction.

&#x200B;

3) After you finish your conversation with Peter, please answer this questionnaire about your experience, it should take no more than 5 minutes to fill and no personal information is recorded: [https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8](https://forms.gle/egR3WnViZapWPEiS8)

&#x200B;

If you do decide to try out my skill, please bear in mind that this is merely a prototype created for academic purposes and is not intended to be a fully realized game.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask!

You don't even need to leave a 5-star review or anything like that, just trying out my skill and answering the questionnaire will help me a lot!

alexa,i573qz,t3_i573qz,"Have routine trigger based on ring detected motion, but only from sunset to sunrise?","So I'm trying to figure out if this is doable.  Config:

Ring stick up cam
Ring alarm hub
Leviton zwave switch controlling outside lights

Alexa can control all the above, but the scheduling is a little weird.  Here's what I'm trying to do:

1. This works already: 15 minutes before sunrise, turn on outside lights. Then at 1015, turn off the outside lights.
2. This is where it's a little tricky... From 1015 to sunrise, I want the lights to turn on if motion is detected and back off 15 minutes later.  It seems I can't schedule a window of time to sunrise for something like this.  So I thought maybe just set the end time to 7am, then set another routine to turn the lights off at sunrise.  But then if motion is detected after sunrise the lights turn back on and don't turn off.

Alexa can control all the above, but the scheduling is a little weird.  Here's what I'm trying to do:

1. This works already: 15 minutes before sunrise, turn on outside lights. Then at 1015, turn off the outside lights.
2. This is where it's a little tricky... From 1015 to sunrise, I want the lights to turn on if motion is detected and back off 15 minutes later.

Over the past three months, I have worked extensively to develop an Alexa Skill that helps households to save money and manage their home inventory through a unique voice interface.

The system allows you to:

* Save more time with an auto-generated grocery list that is sent to your email when it's time restock.
* Save money by using relevant coupons and discounts based on your real consumption.
* Be notified when items are running out or about to expire, and stop wasting food.

All this good can be controlled from your Alexa app when you're out, or at home using simple voice commands such as:

""Alexa, how many Bananas do I have in my kitchen?""

""Alexa, how much milk is left in my kitchen?""

We are currently in the final development phase of private Beta and will be happy to have as many testers as possible to optimize the product before its official launch.

alexa,hvo5g7,t3_hvo5g7,Receiving messages on an Echo Show (for person on their 90s),"Hi,

We’ve long been looking for a way to be able to send quick messages to my mother-in-law. She is absolutely no interest in computers & doesn’t have SMS/texting on her cell phone. 

I’ve wondered about a smart assistant device w/ display. We mostly use Google/Nest in our place but I’m also considering the Echo Show. The assisted living facility where she resides has a captive portal free WiFI & they have several of these around for the residents, so I’m sure it’s compatible with their internet.

I have a few questions about the Echo Show that I cannot answer since I don’t yet use it myself:  
  
Is there a way that we could send her messages to the Echo Show and have them show up on screen or at least tell her that they are available so she could ask about it? She does NOT have a smartphone but we both have iOS/Android devices so we could use the Alexa app to send messages. Does she have to have a smartphone to receive messages on the Echo Show?  
  
What would I need to do to set things up so that we could do calling, video calling, and messages via text (I don’t need it to be SMS, just a short message on screen using whatever protocol).   
  
Would she also have access to any music on this without paying extra? Our household has Prime but she does not. She wouldn’t want any popular music but might like some older stuff, hymns, etc. Is there a child sharing option for the free Prime Music or video?
  
Is there a way we could share photos to her Echo Show?  
  
Is there anything else that can be done on the Echo Show without paying a monthly fee or could we attach her to our Prime in some way? I’m wondering about audiobooks, podcasts, video, news, etc. She has no TV or newspaper and isn’t online so this might provide some interesting connection for her.  
  
Are there any “safety” features that could be enabled - for instance, if she ever fell in her studio apartment, she could call the Echo for help? I seem to remember this being an option without additional fees.
  
Are there any added features that do cost extra and might be worth paying for? If she can’t afford it, perhaps we could take care of that.
  
What is needed to setup/configure her Echo Show? Can I do it without having one myself? I could maybe get it sent to me first, I guess or are there other options?

alexa,husgpz,t3_husgpz,I sold a Smarthome item and Alexa keeps giving me notifications for it.,"Oof I think I’ve gotten myself into a pickle and I can’t seem to ‘undo’ it. 


A few weeks ago I sold a Philips Hue Hub. I have used Hue at my old house and at my new home, and from being gifted many sets I had a few extra Hubs (bridges). I sold it as ‘used’ though wasn’t really sure if I’d ever plugged it in. 


I currently have my Hue set up and normally use Alexa as my Smart Home Assistant. 

Yesterday I was away from home and received notifications from Alexa; “New Hue Device ... Hue White Candle” followed by 10 similar notifications for items I didn’t own. 

I checked my Hue app and these ‘new’ items don’t show up in there, but they did appear in my Alexa app. It seems the old Hue Hub is somehow connected to my Alexa account? My Hue app also only shows one Hub, the one I’m currently using. 

I’m not sure what I need to do, I’ve tried everything but I can’t actually seem to ‘disconnect the old Hue Hub from Alexa and I’m not sure why. Neither Hub (my current or old) are listed in the ‘devices’ on Alexa. 

Everything on the Alexa website says I should be able to delete or disable a Hub from the “devices” screen but ... it’s just not there.

I can delete the individual candles but when I ‘discover’ it just rediscovers them.

alexa,hqbf8p,t3_hqbf8p,Trouble with Alexa Routine,"Hello,

I'm trying to setup a Routine to do the following:

-Set volume to 2

-Play Sleep Sounds

-Wait 1 minute

-Set volume to 1

-Set timer for 29

-Stop audio

1) The 2nd action, ""Play Sleep Sounds"" doesn't work because I'm told that any Skill-based action must be placed at the very end of the Routine. Obviously, this won't work because if I place Play Sleep Sounds as the last step, I won't be able to set my Echo to automatically stop after 30 minutes (1 min initial at volume 2 and the remaining 29 minutes on volume 1). Anyone know a workaround to this?

2) Is there a simpler way to mimic the Alexa action, ""Alexa, set sleep timer for 30 minutes"", instead of what I'm achieving, but using 2 steps (ie Set timer for 29, stop audio).

alexa,ho7qm8,t3_ho7qm8,Issue with some smart devices - Alexa says device is not responding,"I have some smart light switches installed in my house.  Specifically the TP-Link Kasa HS200/HS220.  They seem to work great on their own.  Once they were installed, I downloaded the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  I registered them with the Kasa app and have never had a problem with turning them on/off no matter where I am in the world.

The problem is with integration to Alexa.  I go into Alexa, register the TP-Link Kasa skill, discover the devices, and everything works great!  Or, it has worked great up until about a week ago.  Now, Alexa is constantly saying that ""Living room lights is not responding"", ""Dining room lights is not responding"".  This seems to happen randomly for different Kasa switches.  The only way to get them to respond to Alexa commands is to remove and re add them.  Once I re add the ""broken"" ones, after a little bit a few more stop working with Alexa and I need to re add them again.  Which is a pain and totally defeats the purpose of having purchased them anyway, considering 90% of my reason for buying smart switches was to control them with voice commands.

I don't think the problem is with my home network, because the switches ALWAYS respond when sending commands from within the TP-Link Kasa app on my phone.  Whether I am at my house, or out in the world, or on a WiFi network, the Kasa app never fails.  But the link between the Kasa switches and Amazon Alexa seems to be totally unreliable.  For weeks after I installed them, everything was working great.  But as of a couple weeks ago, it's just a mess.

Again, the TP-Link switches always work perfectly when controlled through the Kasa app on my phone, whether I am at home or not.  I also have other non TP-Link smart devices (sockets, bulbs, the Echo units themselves, etc.) which all work perfectly.  When I run a tcpdump from my router, I can see that for the ""broken"" devices, a signal never comes from the Internet to control the smart switch, whereas it does for the other devices that are currently working, some of which are other Kasa devices controlled through the same Alexa skill.

I have tried the following without arriving at a permanent fix:

\-Assigning static DHCP leases to all my devices (just in case)

\-Removing and re adding all of the TP-Link smart switches from Alexa

\-Removing and re adding the TP-Link Kasa Alexa skill

\-Restarting the smart devices

\-Restarting my wireless router

None of these fixes have made any difference.  And, of course, why would they when the problem seems to be related to the Skill link in the cloud between Alexa and TP-Link Kasa.

I’m aware the Sonos setup will sound better, but how much ‘better’? Is the Beam package worth the extra $1300?  
 

I was just going to plug the TV into the amazon echo via 3.5mm.  
 I want to listen to music and watch HD sports/movies. I like that the Sonos can be mounted on stands. We like alexa and heard the Sonos ONES had poor microphones, however I’m really wondering does anyone have experience with the microphones on the BEAM? Are they better than the frowned upon mic’s in the ONE compared to Echo.  
 

I could also do a pair of Sonos 5’s for $1200 AUD or 2 x Echo Studio’s for $660.  
 

What’s the best value here? Anyone have experience with both products??

It achieves this by making a majority of the tedious (to me mind boggling) coding language a thing of the past and puts everything you need into a DIY drag and drop template profile creator (kind of like Amazon's own but EVEN better and more direct)

&#x200B;

I know absolutely NOTHING about coding (not for a lack of trying mind you) and ive created things such as this [https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467](https://creator.voiceflow.com/demo/462855662848467) which is the Federal News Network from Starship Troopers (Would you like to know more?)

It's a simple gag skill that plays each of the movies propaganda reels sounds one after another upon replying yes to ""Would you like to know more"", stupidly simple to some, suicidal rage inducing weeks of frustration because i cant code to others (like me) without this site.

&#x200B;

Now youre probably wondering why im sucking this sites dick so much and its simple, IT DESERVES TO BE SUCKED. As stated its run by 3 guys named Braden, Nicholas, and Andrew,  along with 16 other incredible people and all of them are not only REAL people, they interact with you on a personal 1 on 1 basis.

&#x200B;

For example, the reason im making this to begin with is because i asked them a random noob question about whether or not i could make an invocation use a random undefined word so i could make a ""Where is my ""X"" "" (x=any single word of my choosing in the moment, IE keys, book etc) and not only did Nicholas reply to me at 1:30am for whats probably the most basic noob question ever and take the time

And two, no, I don't really want you calling me by name. You're not my friend, you're a computer program. Please answer concisely and stop by the waying me.

What do you all think? Do you like your Alexa to call you by your name?"

alexa,hdvx7y,t3_hdvx7y,Multiple Instances of Wemo and Hue Devices,"I'm sure this is a fairly common problem, just hope there's a known solution.

My hardware:

SmartThings Hub v2.0.

Various echos throughout the house.

AppleTV with Homekit enabled.

Mostly GE Z Wave switches and devices.

Also some legacy Wemo switches.

Some Philips Hue bulbs.

My goal:

To be able to use either Alexa or Siri to control devices. While I typically use Alexa, there are enough situations where it's just far more convenient to use my iPhone without opening the Alexa app.

The problem:

The Wemo and Hue hardware all shows up with 3 instances in the Alexa app. This causes it to be very unreliable. Only one of them actually works (always the one controlled by SmartThings)

My suspicion is that Alexa is scanning and finding a Wemo switch on the Wemo app (it has the Wemo skill) and on the ST hub, and maybe on the Homekit app? It doesn't have a Homekit skill. If not there, I don't know where the 3rd instance comes from.

I found one article that suggests limiting Alexa's ability to find devices on ST. My problem with that solution is twofold:

1. It presumably only eliminates one instance.
2. The ST version is the reliable working instance.

Has anyone else experienced Alexa switching languages in the middle of an interaction? If so, any advice? I have not turned on any languages at any given time or anything. I do, however, live in a primarily-French-speaking place"
alexa,hd2o7v,t3_hd2o7v,Echo / Audible / Spotify annoying af,"I bought a new Echo for the kitchen and decided to move the Dot to beside my bed. 
As I like listening to audiobooks/ podcasts before going to sleep, I figured the Dot would sound better than my iPhones inbuilt speaker. 

First thing I went to do was disable the mic, since I don’t really want it listening all the time. Turns out the red ring stays on permanent, no way to turn it off. Can’t have this staying on all night, not a fan of light in the room

Next thing was using Audible. Turns out I have to use the Alexa app to play them through the Dot, so once that was setup I started playing a book, however there is no option to play at 1.5x speed, nor is there the option to set a sleep timer from inside the app. 

So I thought, Spotify will work with the Dot, I must be able to set a sleep timer with that. However when I go to set the sleep time in Spotify, it says I can’t and I need to disconnect from the Dot to do this. 

The biggest reason for having a sleep time set from the app/phone is if my wife is already asleep, the last thing I want to do is start talking to Alexa and wake her up / scary the shit out of her. 

Really disappointed with the fragmentation of these smart things. Everything seems to work on their own but not together.

Ok, it is kind of strange that I can’t do this.

Has anyone figured out how to go back multiple tracks while listening to music?

You can go back to the beginning of the current track using “go back”, “skip back”, “go to previous” and what have you.

But no matter what, you seem to be able to go back to the beginning of the current song, not to any of the previous songs, which is really inadequate.

I looked up, and even this comprehensive webpage doesn’t tell you you can go back multiple tracks.

alexa,hbooxd,t3_hbooxd,Alexa Devices Break Right After Warranty -- Customers are SOL,"I've suddenly started having volume issues with my Echo Plus device. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day. 

I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.

The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about.  ???  Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another alexa device.... (Why would I buy another Alexa device that I'm sure will just break down as soon as it's out of its warranty period??)

This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault? 

I expect these devices to last longer than a year.... I'm very frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction. 

Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.

There is no game setup, you jump straight into battle. I've taken full advantage of screen displays with animations and transitions, etc, but it plays perfectly well using a Dot and the companion app.

I used one before as a PC speaker because it was most comfortable and the sound was okay.

What the great minds of Amazon didn't think about/what's wrong with it:

You can't use two, when being in Bluetooth mode. So you can't use it to play audio from your PC or when steaming music via Bluetooth from your phone to it. only one is working then.

It's having a huge latency when it comes to song selection via Spotify and has problems in general. Like I chose a song on Spotify via phone or computer and it takes several seconds until it starts. Then sometimes only one works when even though the 'room' is selected and not one single Alexa. 
Sometimes it takes almost a minute until it works as it should.

The best part: you stick headphones in? Well yeah the sound is now in your headphones, but the Alexa won't mute itself. So you have to select one Alexa and then stick the headphones in. But the Alexa which is the right channel, won't be shown as a selection.

alexa,gzqy3d,t3_gzqy3d,Smart Plugs turn on when I say turn on lights,"Hi all,

I hope someone is here who can explain me what is going on with my Alexa...

I  haven´t used Alexa much for Smart Home control for the last year or so. Since I made switch to Home Assistant a few weeks back, I now wanted to use Alexa more again. So far most of the things are working well and I found my ""love"" for Alexa again 😁.

&#x200B;

There is only one strange behavior. I do have a few smart plugs that I do use to turn on several ""dumb"" devices e.g. a Pond, a Globe, ""dumb"" Lightstrip etc.

In the Alexa App I set the type for these devices to Plug (""Stecker"" in german) as I don´t want them to turn on when I say ""Turn on the lights in the Living Room"".

Alexa seems to ignore this and still turns on/off switches when I use the light phrase.

I first thought that this may be something thats related to Home Assistant skill. I then tried to connect a Belkin WeMo directly to Alexa and got the same behavior. So nothing that has to do with the skill.

Does anyone have an idea?

alexa,gx6j15,t3_gx6j15,I am an idiot,"I bought a Tap dirt cheap on FB two days ago.  It costs 15 bucks.  It's in great shape.  I was buying it specifically to replace my Kitchen Echo.

So I wanted to keep my kitchen filled with music and thought the Tap could be part of an audio group.  NOPE.  So, is there a device that is JUST a speaker for  music that works with Alexa Audio Groups?  

Don't get me wrong, I love this Tap.  It's great.  Sounds good.  The charging dock and portability are awesome.  IDC that they're discontinued.  But aside from getting 3rd gen Dots and just muting them, I'd like to know if what I desire exists.

Typically we will get the notification then an hour or so later the notification is gone, I was waiting for the wife to get home one day when a notification came in and was waiting for her to get home is how I discovered they are going away. I received another notification today and I asked where's my package and the reply is "" I didn't find any open orders, you can check your orders page on amazon.com"" I logged into my acconut and I have no orders pending at all.

alexa,gva2xm,t3_gva2xm,Skill idea? A skill that helps you remember where you put things.,"tl;dr: You tell the device where you put things, then ask and the device recalls it for you. If someone makes this they will literally be a god in my eyes.

I came up with this idea, but have no idea how to put it into action. Basically you say ""Alexa, I put my wallet on my desk"" or something like that, and then you go about your life. Then, when you forgot where you put your stuff, you ask ""Alexa, where did I put my wallet?"" and then it responds ""You put your wallet on your desk.""

I don't have much experience coding in the languages that are used to make skills, and even then only have experience coding apps, but here's how I guess it would work:

The trigger phrase would be ""Alexa, I put my \*object\* \*location\*"" or even Alexa, my \*object\* is \*location\*"" then it would remember the object and the location, and when you give the recall trigger, ""Alexa, where did I put \*object\*?"", it finds the location that correlates to the object and relies ""You put \*object\* \*location\*.""

If you say the same object twice, it automatically replaces the older of the object's location with the newer one.

*Target audience:*

I have no idea if this is actually feasible, but i it is and somebody decides to go and make it, I want to give more info on who might actually use this.

I have ADHD and I know it would be a major help to those with ADHD who forget where they put things, as well as older people who forget where they put things. Let's face it, everyone forgets where they put things and I'm sure it would be quite a useful skill.

alexa,guhavl,t3_guhavl,Routines aren't correctly changing Lifx bulbs.,"Before I begin my rant, I should mention I did upgrade my router recently to a Asus AX-3000.

Only use % for brightness"" Then she gets confused on which device I'm trying to control.

Now I noticed my custom routines aren't completely changing my lights colors over to my desired setting.  They tend to get stuck on the previous color and only adjust my requested brightness within the routine.  But if I make a voice command to each device separately, they do switch to my desired color.
