From what i understand the issue was that the firmware version was not in the same range as the rest of the group which were all updated as they were google speakers.

After about 4 days google home seemed to push the updated firmware through to the JBL speaker. 

I couldn't find any way of updating myself so it seems like something google home controls.

It also made me realise that if you buy third party speakers you are at the mercy of the manufacturer and if they update the firmware regularly....

If you click on eacb speaker it will tell you their firmware number. Eg my google speakers are on cast v 1.49.22etc. When I bought the jbl speaker it was back on 1.3 something or other, but its now on 1.49",t3_igq3da

521,g2o4arz,t3_ifd2sq,"Is there a reason you want to use a Google Home device as a soundbar? I know you said not to take sound quality into account, but that's a real problem with any basic home hub device. They're just not meant to replace any kind of home audio function other than casual music streaming.

Buying a new soundbar with Google Assistant built in [(several options exist](https://thehometheaterdiy.com/soundbars-with-google-assistant/)) would seem like a much better choice if your desire is one device to fill both needs.",t3_ifd2sq
522,g2oj6vr,t1_g2o4arz,The main reason is the price. I was surprised with the quality of the google nest mini and I suppose the quality of the home max or the new nest would be good enough compared to my actual soundbar. And.. I lost the controller of my soundbar so I have to get up everytime to change source or volume. A new soundbar with google assitant is 500$cad (sonos) and a google home max is 250$cad in sale right now.,t3_ifd2sq
523,g2s12xv,t1_g2oj6vr,"Well, you CAN do it. If your TV doesn't have Bluetooth audio output, then you'll just be using a headphone plug to the aux input on the Max. No 5.1 or virtual surround (everything will downmix to stereo), no real equalizer or audio settings on the Home Max (just whatever is on your TV), and of course no multiple inputs (if you want to connect more than your TV, it's Bluetooth or swapping the input plug).

On top of all that, you'll also have to switch manually to aux input (with a voice command) if the speaker is already playing something else when you turn the TV on.

For me, the Google Home Max is in the useless valley (too expensive for a smart home hub, too little performance as a primary audio device). I'd personally recommend getting a cheaper home hub like a mini and saving up to get a better soundbar later, but that's just me. Definitely do you.",t3_ifd2sq

That could potentially hurt the BLE connection pretty severely. With the C by GE app, the bulbs connect directly to the phone, and not a hub across the home.

But ...

I've figured out a way - in theory - that was possible and hopefully will be possible again in the near future.

You will need following apps:

* [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_US), central platform for automation purposes
* [Hue Essentials](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superthomaslab.hueessentials&hl=en_US), supports Hue BT bulbs, lamps and Tasker plugin
* [AutoVoice](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autovoice&hl=en_US), Tasker plugin, intercepts GA - **currently disabled in GA**, see below **It is not banned in the Play Store**

It would work as following:

You define a spoken command in GA that starts AutoVoice (Tell AutoVoice ""Light On"" to start a specific task in Tasker - Action: Hue Essential: Light On = true - and send the command to Hue Essential. In the end you would say:

Hey/Ok Google, Light on.

*Why is this not possible at the moment?* A few days ago Google decided to disable AutoVoice in GA/GH due to advocating hate or violence or promoting discrimination.

For further reference:  [\[DEV\] AutoVoice Removed From Google Assistant](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/i9kamu/dev_autovoice_removed_from_google_assistant/)

One part is:

>User: ""sag autovoice schließen""

Translation: User: ""tell autovoice to close"", in fact ""schließen"" which is ""to close"" sounds similar to ""schießen"" which is ""to shoot"".

The other example is ridiculous, too.

So chances are not to bad, that AutoVoice will be reactivated very soon.

Mine were disconnecting and reconnecting because some would toggle between 2.4 and 5ghz, being on separate networks and unable to sync with my phone or hub.

Also could there be some network issue?   We also have Google WiFi and we do have a puck in our bedroom that is very close to both speakers.

Me and wife both also have Google Home clock radios (Insignia) with temp on our nigh stands.   That is what we interact the most with and then the media defaults to the Maxes.

My experience in which speaker needs to respond is mixed, I would say about 1 out 10 times it would respond to a Google/nest device not even close where I'm trying to interact with it. When I'm talking to the max it would most of the time respond to the mini in my son's room or sometime to the hub max in our bedroom. Completely stumps me as to how this is possible. 

It might be network related but my phone/laptop/TV/IoT devices all work well with my current wifi installed, just the home max that's a pain in the neck. It feels like it was some low key effort by the developers 🙈. Because of this I refuse to spend anymore money on Google related products such as wifi pucks, cameras or a slate.

You could just tell it to play specific things and it just *did it* without getting in your face with bloat and unwanted noise.

You could switch easily between a now-playing context and a library/search context, instead of either usage being tucked away awkwardly as if its use were discouraged. It felt like the software was *yours*, rather than being a spastic billboard forcing its way into your eyeballs while you're trying to be cozy with your favorite music, spewing “this is what a plurality of teenagers are listening to right now, so you're required to love it”-type light/sight pollution that you can't get rid of.

Also, you got 10 DRM-free downloads every month as part of the subscription.

For me particularly, Zune left no room for improvement on the “I know what I want to listen to, perhaps in a particular order” usage-flow, which is almost exclusively how I listen to music. Even when shuffling my own playlists (in whatever context), I'll tend to skip half the songs because of my current mood. When I listen to “suggested music” (in whatever context) I'll skip about 4 out of 5, or just give up on the suggestions. When I create an ad-hoc 5-star rating system, I'm better at listening to my 5-star songs, though. It is a crime that 5-star rating systems fell out of favor.

I can’t afford to pay for 100s of subscriptions which it’s what we’re heading to. Companies know once someone is paying for a subscription they’re unlikely to cancel it for potentially months, if not years after they use it.

Then there’s the subscriptions that use no cloud services, or shouldn’t need to use one but the developers just want to mug people each month under the guise of “well we need to keep developing/bug fixing the app”

Well no offence to developers but if I buy a new car and it doesn’t drive, I’d expect the dealer to fix it for free. I don’t care if the next car comes with a mini bar, I just want the car to do what I bought it for, to drive and not have to pay a damn subscription!

So I’m a buy once and use it until it breaks person or it no longer does what I need but as everything goes over to subscription, I’m now trying to find open source alternatives because it seems open source these days seems to have more developers who care about what they do rather than trying to use it to become another arrogant rich person!",t3_ie4w4m

The super final really annoying and honestly the dumbest of them all is that my YouTube tv is linked to my GSuite account and there is NO option of changing your email.  None!

The only option they provide is cancelling and signing back up again.. So that means obviously losing all my recordings and Favorite'd shows and manually having to do that all again.",t3_idq4sd
1083,g2bdnsg,t3_idq4sd,"I've been in your boat. I was a long time GSuite user, from back in the day when it was free and pushed as a way to have your own personal domain for your family. I was also a Google fan boy, and still love my Pixel phone. But then I started buying the Google Home devices and started using Assistant. With every new feature that was release, I felt like I wasn't able to take advantage of them. I couldn't use Google Family to manage kids devices, I couldn't add reminders. I wasn't sure what I was going to to. I didn't want a standard gmail.com account because I've had my email address for 10 years. After months of contemplating what to do, I discovered two things. First, the Microsoft 365 personal edition allows you to have your own personal domain. A single email address unfortunately, but that was all I needed. I also discovered that you can have a Google account without a Gmail inbox that uses your own email address. Just a regular old Google account and the only thing missing is Gmail. This was perfect as I didn't want yet another mailbox to manage. I went on a crusade several years ago to reduce all of my accounts.

So over the next several months, I began to plan. I knew I would lose everything on my old Google account (I HAD to close it to be able to keep the email address). I looked at every purchase made in the app store, I ensured that I had all of my Google Play music, I backed up various items on my phone like SMS (going to require a reset). Then I started the Google Takeouts. I did one product at a time, going back and making sure I had everything I needed. I wanted to transfer my old email and made sure that Microsoft Outlook, which I had from a previous install (Microsoft's Home Use Program), could open the MBOX file for Gmail so that I could upload it all into my new [Outlook.com](https://Outlook.com) account. One other thing... make sure you take all of your Google Docs and convert them to regular document formats. Even if going to another Gmail account. They will not come back.

The I finally made the switch. Google immediately killed the mailbox and I was able to turn around and sign-up for the non-Gmail version right away. I signed my phone in with that and started the process of rebuilding my life with all of my Google devices. I then setup my [Outlook.com](https://Outlook.com) account with a generic account, added the domain, and (later learned to) signed in with my personal email address at my domain into my phone while uploading my old email, contacts, and calendar.

I'm happy I made the switch. I don't miss Gmail and I'm happy that I am able to finally do all of the Googley things. But I also love the Outlook experience, along with OneDrive that has a few features that Google Drive doesn't, such as the personal vault. I've even considered the Surface Duo to further move away from Google fan boy to just Google user, but the price tag is just a bit too much for me yet.",t3_idq4sd

1085,g2bfbgh,t3_idq4sd,"I did exactly this, moving from a paid GSuite to a free Google one.

The reason why I did it, apart from the ""various ways Google screws us"", is also that I moved from the UK to Australia, and my GSuite was a UK account. For some reason, Google couldn't change it to an Australian account, so I couldn't download any of the Aussie apps, but worse, my subscription to Google Play Music was a UK one, and if you continually use an overseas account, Google reserve the right to close your entire GSuite account without warning. That was a risk I couldn't run.

So eventually, I forwarded my mail from GSuite to my Gmail; shared all Google Drive doc's with my Gmail account, and logged out of my GSuite account.

I'm still paying for it.",t3_idq4sd
1086,g2br320,t3_idq4sd,"Same deal with me. I was forced to go back and use my Gmail address for everything. I now use gsuite only for my email, keeping my domain, but the rest I moved it all back to Gmail. 

Main issue I found was with google photos. I had tons of albums , and there's no way to move/copy them to my Gmail. You can copy the pictures, but album structure is gone. I don't feel like remaking all albums, so for now I left all albums on gsuite acct, and all pics I take are shared with my gsuite acct, so then I can still create albums there.

On my G Suite account I added my new Google account to partner sharing. This loaded all of my pictures into my new account. I then opened up every album in an incognito tab in Chrome (signed into my G Suite account), and one-by-one created sharing links and pasted them into my non-incognito browser window signed into my new Google account. When done this way, one of the menu options is to add all photos in the shared album to a new album in the new account. I did that once per album and had no duplicate photos and was able to keep my existing album structure.

This may or may not be your problem, or you may have variations of this problem.


I had a similar problem where we started out with a few disparate things and just the separate apps for them so I would load them up for myself and my wife and get us both synced up. Eventually we wanted them to talk, so we would route things together like, my hue stuff would be in my samsung smart things app (no hub) because we have a tv with them and it could auto dim or turn off lights for movies etc.

Then we wanted more control and mixed alexa and Google..


This is where it all went visibly wrong and ""broken"".

The services were so intermingled and we both had ties that adding us both to google home had this web of linked accounts. And each service was linking back and forth. Google could never show us the status of my Sengled bulbs would take forever for hue, and just didn't even try to add the tv.


I had to go back and unlink our accounts from everything, start the home, or sorts that broke over. Smarthings app only has the tv, Sengled is on me alone, hue me alone, etc.

Re register all services then we all go through GHome, everything has been snappy, near instant and no problems since.


Just to elaborate a second on the follow on linking.. if you get services that pass through from others, like you link smarthings and it had hue for example then it's calling samsung to call hue. Worse if you linked hue to samsung and also link it directly it often gets confused about which endpoint to use when there are delays and you wind up with no status, clunky responses or just nothing working. 


So make sure you single link when your using a central system like GHome",t3_idpgwi

FYI, the device itself uses Sonoff so you can integrate it with something like HomeAssistant if you want and it is seen as a switch.

There isn't any other controls beyond on and off, but there isn't anything out there that does more.  In fact there aren't many (any?) that even are compatible with a smart speaker beyond this so it's pretty much the only game in town.  You CAN control the rate and colors from the app though.  You might be able to cobble something together with Tasker but I've never found a need to try it so I can't tell you for sure.

That is _probably_ doable but I'm not certain. One option might be to get a dedicated wifi <-> ethernet bridge and use that as the ""WAN"" connection into the UDM.

Yelling at Google to give your cat a treat in the middle of the night isn't a solution to your problem - it's only going to reinforce your cat continuing to wake you up every single night.

Cats are actually pretty trainable. The ideal solution here is to tire your cat out before you go to bed, so that he or she sleeps through the night without waking you up. It'll take a little time to change the cat's routine but as long as you're consistent it should work. If you absolutely need to, I'm sure you could find some sort of smart laser pointer to automate this, but I'd honestly not recommend that as it's important to spend time bonding with cats by playing.",t3_idbvbb

1384,g25b85d,t3_icjpng,"This is a really common occurrence for IR security cameras. Spiders are constantly building a web in front of them to catch bugs that are attracted by the IR light. This happens to my cameras almost daily and can be interesting when their web becomes loose. The IR light will reflect off certain parts of the string of web - making an orb like glow while leaving the rest of the string invisible. Add a little breeze and it looks like there are light orbs moving around on the camera feed. 

The spiders finding the camera makes me question if the spider somehow knows it's a popular spot for bugs or if the spider can also see the IR light and is attracted to it while somehow knowing that it will also attracted other edible bugs?

Any ideas? 

Maybe the spider isn't attracted to the IR light but the warmth generated by the camera and light? 

What would be something similar in nature? A night time light/ heat/ IR source? Or is this an example of spiders adapting to humans technology?",t3_icjpng

The only way around it is to name the routine something unique but that defeats the purpose of using a common phrase.

Turn on the shower light, <10 seconds later there's a few beeps as it pairs with the mini on the other side of the room, and we're good to go.  I can yell and get stuff playing IN the shower, it's loud enough to be heard over the water spraying down.  
And when finished, get out shower, turn off light, and about 20 seconds later, or the next song, it picks up again from the mini on the wall.   
The mini's just not good enough the belt out volume to be heard in the shower, but this works fantastic.  So good, I'd like to get for the OTHER shower room but I can't find it on the home depot website anymore.  
Think a regular bluetooth shower speaker might have to end up being used, but would prefer the overhead combo light/speaker unit.

Hello DL,

Thank you for contacting Samsung SmartThings Support.

I am writing this in regards to your query on adding Google home with no Device selection.We apologize for the inconvenience.

This is a new change from Google's end that Google Home will pull all the devices whichever is compatible with it. Sorry if this caused any inconvenience.

We also have tagged this ticket as a feature request to bring back the feature of Device selection, so our Developers will look into this and might bring this feature in future app updates.

For any further assistance, please reach out to us. We are happy to assist.

Best regards,

Have you tried rebooting your speakers/displays and your router? Also make sure the Spotify app is up to date, I’ve had Spotify Connect issues in the past and updates solved those problems!

You'll need for the TV to support HDMI-CEC with CEC turned on (basically this is what allows the TV to turn on automatically through an HDMI command).  It's called Bravia Sync on your TV.

 You'll also have to plug the Chromecast into a wall outlet and not use your TV's USB ports for its power, because that would mean the Chromecast will be off when the TV is off.

I have all of my IOT devices running on one and everything else on another network which is password protected.  I could get it working as long as I connected it to the password network.  I could move it to the passwordless one and it would work for 12-24 hours and then go back to the original 'I can't connect to the internet' error.  I ended having to leave it on the password protected network and tied it via my router to the passwordless one.

But I definitely uninstalled the Google Home app and reinstalled it again, this time it worked and the Nest Hub wasnt lost in its ""pairing"" with Google Home.

the symptoms of this particular problem are 

1) no password for wifi access

2) Google devices were working fine then suddenly they say ""can not connect to the internet""

3) older 1st gen Google Home and Mini that have recently updated to cast firmware 1.49.218411 

4) if you try removing the devices from the app then reinstalling they will get to the last step where they connect to wifi and 'something went wrong' and they will further just respond with ""this device is not set up yet...""

5) if you do a 'factory reset', right before the final step the device might 'install an update', however the 'factory reset' does not clear the cast firmware nor reinstall a new one or the bad firmware

6) you might be able to still see the devices listed as connected to your wifi router just fine; and if you can still find them in your app, click 'settings' for them and scroll down to the bottom to check if they are running cast firmware 1.49.218411

OK, this sounds like my issue.  I'm not home at the moment so I can't check the firmware version, but everything else fits.

 they have had their numbers skyrocket lately. (they sold 30 million smart speakers and displays in 2019 alone. which has been surpassed by this year already.) the popularity of smart speakers/displays/hubs ...google Home, Alexa, Siri...etc. has surprised experts by about double the numbers they expected.  the resultant demand is much more than they anticipated....so, their servers get overwhelmed.  fortunately if this is indeed the problem...it is easily fixable.

And sometimes it'll understand me correctly but verify by repeating the command back to me so I tell it ""yes"" before it completes the command. It only does it for that one light. And I've tried changing the name to see if it was semantics like ""nightstand"" vs ""night stand"" (i.e. diningroom vs dining room perform differently as I've tested and bed room vs bedroom as well), but it just doesn't like ""night stand"" as a device name.

I also have a hard time getting it to play from Google play movies with voice commands.

Also I'm connected to more than one home (so I can troubleshoot for my parents speaker) and I didn't realize that the broadcast feature speaks to all the speakers you're connected to. Not just the ones on your current wifi network or latest home setting. 

I really wish you could use the speakers as walkie talkies or to ""listen in"". Like you could say ""hey Google walkie talky with name_of_speaker"" and it would connect you two way with another room. Or ""hey Google  listen in on name_of_speaker"" and it would create a one way connection between those speakers or that speaker and the phone. 

It would also be really nice if you could transfer/expand calls made on the speaker. Like while in a call say ""hey Google transfer call to speaker/room_name"" or even straight to your phone. Or ""hey Google expand call to speaker/room_name/all speakers"" and the connection would be like a multi-way call

And transfer casting between Chromecasts.

* There could be an unknown 0Day for the cameras: Ok sure, but there could also be an unknown 0 day for literally everything else too, so there's not really any point worrying about or trying to stop this. 

* Google account: a while ago Google made the wise decision to merge nest and Google accounts. This resulted in a single account using Google's excellent account security.

Some of these systems are so pathetically insecure that they can be compromised by *automatic scripts* scanning for and trying common vulnerabilities, so it's not even a question of ""who would want to spy on *me*?"" - you could easily be caught and compromised by a dumb, automatic script which only reports back to its owner when it's already been successful.

Externally-facing cameras are obviously a little less serious (at worst if they cover your front door an attacker can know whenever the property's empty and/or may be able to build a calendar of your frequent visitors and movements), but internal ones are a big no-no amongst security professionals and anyone who actually understands how these things work.

Honestly I would go with a wired solution, or a WiFi camera with no external accessibility outside your network (or, no remote management from outside the local network, no ""cloud backup"", etc) so you can be sure your data is staying inside your WLAN, and you aren't required to poke any holes in your firewall for the camera to work.",t3_ia16j4

So changing the password to a secure one (8 characters with at least a capital letter, a small letter, a digit and a special character) should be totally enough to be sufficiently secured.

Sure, maybe you get lucky and you don't happen to be running any devices with vulnerabilities matching the ones in his automated exploit package, so he just skips into the next unlucky bugger... or maybe he *automatically* waltzes in through an unsecured SSH service running on a common TCP port on your camera's external IP address, scans the local network and finds nothing of interest so he just drops a botnet client on one of two of your machines and then leaves.

2458,g1gnwfb,t1_g1glmkx," Yes, one zone but it’s designed for 4 wired non sonos speakers or 6 Sonos architectural speakers but the way my wiring is that I have in ceiling speakers in master bath and outside that are one line together and living room ceiling as another. M bath and outdoor each had a place for in wall volume adjustment. So technically can use one amp for it all however we wanted some nice speakers for outdoor and not the super expensive architectural Sonos ones and since we don’t care about m. Bath speakers at all and living room bc we have GH Max in there so we spliced in and ignore the bathroom completely and are not hooked into the living room line and in the end we could get 2 nicer 8ohm speakers for outdoors.  If we ever decided to actually use the in ceiling in living room or m. Bathroom we would need another amp or get smaller ohm speakers.",t3_i9n6ov

Once C By GE app is all set, THAT'S when you open the Google Home app. Delete your bulbs from the Google Home app, then re-link your C By GE account. Once everything is linked, you can rename your bulbs in Google Home from there and move them to different rooms (note: still be sure they're in the same room in the C by GE app!)

Now, all of your bulbs will be wifi-enabled and can be controlled by both apps simultaneously. You can even control your lights from outside your home on a totally different wireless network.

TV to one speaker paired mode: to much lag
TV to splitter to two speakers unpaired: about 0.1 sec lag.  I want them to add sound to the TV speakers as I want to hear the sound coming from the screen. I put the Max's at around 74% volume and then I couldn't hear the lag anymore but it does add some nice bass to the TV experience.  I do need to unplug the cables when I am done to prevent noice and also to repair the speakers for radio and music.

Conclusion: Yes it works, kinda but I don't think I will go thru the hassle every time.  The TV experience is marginally better.   

I do understand the problem. In reality the TV needs to delay itself by 0.7 seconds video and audio but sends aux audio out directly. And sync slider function  on Android TV could solve this. But then it will totally mess up gaming.

If I use the GH or Nest apps to view the camera then all that happens on the Hub is that the little green light that shows that the camera is active begins to flash faintly on and off very slowly.

I see however that if I use the apps to view the camera whilst the screen is still active and showing my Google Photos then a small oval button appears top left showing 2 icons, a camera and a person. If I press this button the banner 'Nest camera is being viewed' appears and the screen stays active until I stop viewing on the app whereas normally it switches off automatically after 5 minutes. So if you dont want that banner but want to keep displaying the slide show than switch off the notifications and all you'll get is the oval button when the app is active or else to get rid of that button too set the screen to the timeout setting.

Nonsense - Google Home identifies the voice of the requester and answers for them, based on their data (so for example if I ask it's what's on the calendar it reports my appointments and any on our shared calendar, and if my wife asks then it reports her appointments and any shared calendar items).

Guests (unrecognised voices) don't have access to any personal data for any other user.

The setup you're describing is ridiculous - it would be a gaping and obvious security hole in the entire Google ecosystem, whihc would be a death sentence for a company whose entire business model is handling users' private personal data.

@MiahPenguin- The routine obviously does all kinds of things.  Instead of just the routine running, I have the Google Asistant say a lot of what's it doing.  This impresses visitors.  For instance, it will say ""Adjusting lights for bedtime"" and downstairs it will dim certain lights, change the color of lights behind the TV to a reddish-brown. Then, it says ""Now, i'll turn on the stair lights and bedroom lights"" and everyone looks at the stairs and goes ""Oooh"" as the lights come on.  It also turns off the TV, adjusts the thermostat, tells about tomorrow's weather, ect.  Then it says, ""In three minutes, I'll turn off the downstairs lights"", pauses for three minutes to give you time to get upstairs. Once the three minutes is up, it turns off the downstairs lights, and begins playing a nighttime playlist on the upstairs speakers (soft stuff like Norah Jones, James Taylor, ect.).",t3_i90n94

I contacted support and they just told me to do those things I had already done, asked if I changed router settings, etc. but I told them according to the Google Home app the speaker was assigned an IP address by the router and should have connection to the internet like all my other devices.

They said they've had other reports of this and they'd escalate my issue.  They also told me to fill out feedback in the Google Home app just to further bring it to their attention, and hopefully it could be fixed and patched remotely.  They said they'd email me if anything else comes up, so I guess it's just a waiting game now.  The speaker is still slow pulsing all four white lights.",t3_i8way5

I went with Hue, as there's more accessories available. It's the most expensive, but it's one of those things where as long as you don't monkey with it too much, it works perfect 99+% of the time. It's the most expensive option, but it's one of those things where you just want it to work, and it does.  


Something to be aware of as well, whether you're looking at Hue or LIFX, is that the basic white bulbs tend to be fairly dim, in neighborhood of 600-650lm. The standard A19 color bulbs for both are 800lm. All of those tend to be a little dim for use in a floor lamp if it's the primary/single lighting source in a room. For my living room I use a floor lamp with an adapter that allows me to use two color bulbs in a single socket, plus another table lamp in a corner with a color bulb. All tied into a single smart switch  


Hue recently came out with this [1600 lumen dimmable white](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08BNM55KD/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Philips+Hue&qid=1597255495&refinements=p_n_feature_nineteen_browse-bin%3A9692451011&s=hi&sr=1-1), which would be ideal for a floor lamp if tuning the color wasn't important to you.",t3_i8hpze

I contacted google, who suggested my router was to blame... Ah, the classic shift blame gig.

3200,g115y8e,t3_i7cmol,"I have a similar setup, so hopefully I can help you out. 

I'm using a SmartThings hub to control over 100 different devices (over 40 of those are Z-Wave switches, dimmers and fan controllers). I have SmartThings paired with Google Home so that I also have voice control over all my devices, in addition to the control and automation that SmartThings provides. 

The integration between Hubitat and Google will work in a similar way. Google will recognize all of your Hubitat devices and you'll be able to issue a voice command to control them just like you would if the device were controlled directly by the Google speaker. You'll be able to control everything from the Home app as well. 

All Google does is relay the command back to your Hubitat hub, and then Hubitat performs the action. You definitely want Hubitat to control as much as possible, because you'll get the most powerful control and automation that way. 

What you're asking is not basic. This is a pretty advanced setup, but honestly, more people on here should be doing what your doing. Relying on Google for home automation is an exercise in futility. Products like Smartthings, Hubitat and Home Assistant are light years ahead of Google, Amazon and Apple when it comes to device control and automation.",t3_i7cmol
3201,g118cu3,t1_g115y8e,"Thank you for the feedback! I was pretty torn between SmartThings and Hubitat, the fact that SmartThings has its own line of sensors was a huge draw - since, ideally, I'd like to stick with one maker for those instead of going with multiple brands as well. :) Ultimately Hubitat won me over, but I agree with you that (regardless of hub) I'd prefer to have a hub as the brains and let the voice assistant just act as a remote of sorts. I even asked a question about that here a few weeks ago, thinking that there are some signs Google is moving in the direction of wanting to replicate home automation a la SmartThings and Hubitat, but I doubt that'll happen anytime soon - and I would rather set up a strong foundation to start in my blank slate of a condo.

Regarding the light controls, thank you for the feedback! I was specifically thinking of controlling it with touch controls via the Google Nest Hub Max (https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US), but if the lights can be controlled via the Google Home app after setup, it must be possible with the Nest Hub Max as well, I imagine they must run off the same sort of logic for controlling devices.

3202,g11a0k0,t1_g118cu3,"I've been using SmartThings since before Hubitat even existed, and it's served me well. I don't think you can go wrong either way. Having your sensors and devices from the same manufacturer becomes WAY less important once you start using Z-Wave and Zigbee devices instead of WiFi. You can still use the SmartThings branded sensors with your Hubitat hub if you want to. They are perfectly compatible, and a lot of Hubitat people use them. 

I would not count on Google to catch up in the Home Automation space anytime soon. They haven't shown much intent on making their ""hubs"" anything like the true home automation hubs I mentioned. They seem more focused on making Google Assistant a useful voice assistant, and I'm perfectly OK with that.

Looks like u/DavidAg02 answered most of your questions (thanks!) but in case you have anymore, I'm happy to help. We use ST and Hubitat as well (both in the office and at our houses) along with Google Home and I can say for sure that if you have Hubitat connected with your Google Home Hub (I haven't tested the Max, but in videos it looks the same), you can control your lights via touch screen.

I'll admit, one thing that drew me to Inovelli is the awesome community on your website and your activity on Reddit, though I didn't think I'd see you here. :D I've been doing a lot of research into smart home tech (in part to keep me busy while I impatiently wait for the closing date on my condo) and was really impressed with Inovelli for a lot of the same reasons I'm impressed with Hubitat - a small but active company, a very capable device without a lot of extra bells and whistles I don't care about, and most importantly a really active community to help newcomers out. I'm looking forward to setting up the switches later this year and working out how to best set up my condo. I'll probably be drawing a lot of ideas from your support forums for that. 

I've been watching the Google Store for the past month or so, they're having daily deals that aren't huge but are good excuses for me to start buying into their ecosystem. If you wait a few days you may get a discount for buying a Nest Hub Max with something else, though you probably have plenty of smart devices already. :) I picked up a Google Nest Hub Max and a Google Nest Hub for my office and bedroom, respectively. Between that, a new modem and router, and a Hubitat C-7, I should be able to lay a good foundation for building my smart home tech from day one. The Inovelli switches will be my next project, since those will lay a good Z-Wave mesh throughout the condo. From there? No idea, but it'll be fun to find out!

BTW, a big thanks for the ability to buy the switches in packs, that will make purchasing a lot easier. ([Link](https://inovelli.com/red-series-dimmer-switch-10pk/) for the curious! 10 Red Dimmer switches at $35 each.)",t3_i7cmol

Then we'll show how to do it with your specific hub. I'm looking forward to it!

Awesome on the Google products -- I've been very impressed with the Home Hub, it's slick and I like using it as a photo display that syncs to Google Photos. 

As for Hubitat, yes, we love them as well. Myself, Nathan (CSO) and Eric M (CTO) all use Hubitat and love it. It's super fast -- there's a bit of a technical learning curve, but luckily they do have an awesome community too and if you like tinkering, it's a solid choice. 

Yeah, no prob on the 10pk, it was actually something the community suggested, so we made it happen. It's crazy how popular they've been. We've almost sold out completely of our pre-orders lol.

If it's the latter rather than the former, I don't think there's any way to fix that delay.",t3_i7cgl7

3214,g11znro,t3_i7argr,I'm seriously considering giving up on Google Home products altogether.  It's works OK to switch outlets on and off but music playback (which could have been the only killer app it needed) is a complete and total failure.  I'm pretty sure it was devised to simply annoy people into buying YouTube music subscriptions.  Playing to a speaker group has been nothing but a clusterfuck.,t3_i7argr
3215,g130uua,t3_i7argr,The correct station name is  'Chum 104.5' according to Tunein. Tried and it connects but isn't available where I live (outside Canada).

3216,g14v5lp,t3_i7argr,"It could be a problem with your station Chum itself - had you thought about that? It doesn't have to be GH.

People have found a couple workaround.

1 Start the sound on any speaker by routine or voice. Go to the home app. Tap media. Tap the shown speaker name and change it to your desired  speaker.    


2 Start the routine using the home app shortcut. First Go to Routines icon. Tap on edit. Select the desired speaker to play sound. Then tap the routine name to start it.

Else, just pick anything.

Connect your phone to the hot spot.

Set up the Google device. Enable Bluetooth. Hopefully once the Google device's Bluetooth is enabled you ought to be able to connect to it even with the hot spot deactivated.

The reason why I suggested using the apartment's Wi-Fi details in the hot spot is once this goes live the Google device ought just connect to it.

Edit. Adding a caveat to that. For my mk 1 Nest Hub you had to tell it to turn on Bluetooth and it needs an internet connection to respond to that, so, once setup in the Wi-Fi hot spot you'll still need to be connected to Wi-Fi in order to turn Bluetooth on.

If you want to use Google Assistant to listen to your music (that you paid for) you have to subscribe to their shitty, broken, useless music service at YTM or you just don't get to do it. Even if you do subscribe it's a toss up whether it will work or not anyway. YTM is that bad.

I understand that Google/Apple/Amazon are going to nudge us in the direction of subscribing to their services but in Google's case, subscribing doesn't even work most of the time. For some unfathomable reason, Google has decided to remove themselves from contention in the music marketplace.  

Pretty sad when one of Google's chief competitors' products works better on Google speakers than their own.

Most other music services offer a bare bones free tier that is often ad supported but at least functional. Google has opted to make their service suck as much as possible hoping people will subscribe to make it suck slightly less. Trouble is, those of us coming over from GPM see the premium tier of YTM sucks just as bad and isn't worth a penny.",t3_i6hkqo

I need to see if I can migrate the albums I've purchased from Google Play Music into the Amazon Music app. Either way, I'll be pissed off....

If I *can* migrate the songs, I will be in the ridiculous position of only being able to cast songs I have purchased from Google to a Google device by using Amazon's app.

If I can't migrate them, it means that Google is placing restrictions on stuff that I own and purchased in good faith. I didn't get them any cheaper because I bought them from Google. I could just as easily have bought them as a download from Amazon. Realistically, I could have bought them much more cheaply as a second hand CD and just ripped the damn things.",t3_i6hkqo

3830,g0qe438,t3_i5nl6t,"1. Totally possible to set up a single room.  The Home/Nest Mini is just a smart speaker, it doesn't come in a mesh.  I think you *might* be thinking of the Nest WiFi mesh router, which *does* come in a mesh, but would replace your current router (and possibly help the kid's bedrooms get internet).  Regardless, totally possible to set your 12yo's bedroom up on its own
2. To do music and run smart devices all you need is a single device - Nest Mini or the (now discontinued) Google Home will both be fine.  The more money you spend, the nicer the music sounds, but it sounds *okay* from even the cheapest one.
3. The Google Home devices will not work without internet, point blank.  You need to either get wifi to their bedroom, or at least an ethernet cable (and that will require some adapters since it's not natively meant for it).  You could set up an old wifi router as a repeater, you could upgrade to the Google WiFi mesh router.
4.  [https://store.google.com/](https://store.google.com/)  \-- pick your favorite thing from ""Speakers and Displays"" -- I'm a fan of the Nest Hub, it gives you a little bit more to work with having the screen there, *and* it works great as an alarm clock.",t3_i5nl6t
3831,g0qh6uu,t1_g0qe438,"Thank you so much!

&#x200B;

So it probably seems like I'll need the Nest Wifi mesh router (I see they are sold in three packs too) in order to extend a reliable wifi signal to her room.

The Nest Hub is interesting but always thought I would do that in the main area of the house (i.e. kitchen or lounge) rather than in my daughters room.

The Nest mini is the most rudimentary one yeah?

Also, another random question, how does it work if I purchase a chromecast ultra and stick it in the tv, does that make the tv voice activated?",t3_i5nl6t
3832,g0qnd18,t1_g0qh6uu,"You'll need some way of getting internet to her room, yes. Replacing your current router with the wifi mesh router will be the easiest (the old Google WiFi was a 3 pack, the newer Nest Wifi is a 2 pack, they claim it covers the same square footage, and now one of them includes a voice assistant built in) but is by no means required. 

The hub, I have one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom, I love them both.

The mini is the most basic one. Routinely on sale for $25 or less, often given away free work other stuff. 

With a Chromecast, you'll have some voice activated features (""Play xxx on Netflix/YouTube on the yyy TV"" will work, ""Play Comedy Central"" won't without other add-ons)",t3_i5nl6t
3833,g0qp7as,t1_g0qnd18,"Okay thanks! Seems like the two pack nest wifi is probably the best option. You can add a mini to that can't you? So I could put a nest to replace my current modem, then another nest in the kitchen which should extend the wifi to the bedrooms and then a mini in her room for basic functions? Is that a setup that sounds reasonable? That way if her sister complains I can tell her to save up for her own mini for her room.",t3_i5nl6t
3834,g0qw43p,t1_g0qp7as,"I would run your model numbers and/or check with your ISP - I have the cable modem and wireless router as different products, but I know some people have them both in one box - it's usually possible to add the new router on top, but not always (ie I don't want you buying this just based on my recommendations in case you have to do some extra work).

The 2 pack of nest wifi will be set up such that the main one either replaces or works in tandem with your current modem, then the satellite one can go in the kitchen or whatever and will extend the wireless range. 

Mini (or Home, or Home Hub, or whatever) would then go in her room, allowing her to play music, Google by voice, and control lots of different WiFi enabled smart devices (which would need to be added to your network as well). Sister can absolutely add her own smart speaker too, yes. I'm currently rocking... 3 minis, 2 homes, 2 hubs, 2 insignia devices, and a nest guard (which has a smart speaker built in). There's literally one in every room, but they're on sale so much I can't resist.",t3_i5nl6t
3835,g0phldx,t3_i5il2k,"So, if the google home device is in the same room (not physically, but on the app) as the light you are controlling, it will just do it. If it is in any other room, it will tell you (because it's doing something where it isn't located).

The kitchen one also shares with the livingroom but I believe they are set up under the same room.",t3_i5il2k
3839,g0rg1sn,t1_g0qyvo4,"If you open the ""Home"" app on your phone and scroll down, it should show all of the rooms you have set up, and what devices are assigned to each of those rooms. If you scroll all the way to the bottom it will show you devices that are not assigned to any room, and you can select them and assign them to a room. Note that Google has no way to know where an item is actually physically located. You can assign a Home device to ""living room"" and then put it in the bathroom. If you do that, and then tell it to ""turn on the lights,"" it will turn on the living room lights without speaking.

If you speak to a Home or Mini or Hub or any other control device that is assigned to a room, it will control the lights that are assigned to that room without any speech. Also, if you just say ""lights"" without specifying which lights, and the device and the lights are assigned to the same room, it will default to that same room.

For instance, I have a Mini in the living room, a Mini in the family room, a Mini in the master bedroom, and a Mini in the Kitchen. 

I also have lights in each of those rooms, except the master bedroom.

If I am in the family room and I say, ""Hey google, turn on the lights,"" it will turn on the lights in the family room but it won't say anything. If say ""Turn on the Living Room lights, it will say, ""OK, turning on two lights,"" and turn on all the lights. If I say ""turn on the family room lights and the living room lights,"" it turns on the family room lights silently, and then says, ""Ok, turning on two lights,"" and turns on the living room lights.

You can't assign devices to more than one room, but you can have devices that are not assigned to any room.",t3_i5il2k

Yes on the modem, as long as they have nothing else running on there that should be good. Maybe the cable will help, but the fact that all your slowdowns seem to be on your wireless clients kind of makes me think it is something else.

To test this, can you hard wire anything in to the router and do a speed test? If the test comes back with expected speeds, this will ultra confirm its a wireless network problem. If that's the case, a possibility as mentioned may be your devices are being placed on a 2.4 GHz network opposed to 5ghz.

It felt pretty counter intuitive really, setting it up the first time as I wanted to see if I could have some control using google kids setup and parental control on their mobile devices and combining that with the google nests mini's in their rooms (so they wouldn't really need the mobile devices anymore to play music (but in the end used them for something else instead of doing their homework) and an individual spotify account.

However that does not work like that at all. Had to get rid of the the whole Google child account and parental control approach, which I would have preferred to be able to combine.

4066,g1t4t1j,t3_i4xxe2,"Ok so i'm just going to vent here.

The smart home is DEAD. and the blame is on Google and Amazon, but i'm going to talk about google here.

The entire point of smart home is automation. Devices from different manufacturer's working with one another. But ever since google announced the whole nest migration thing, devices that work with nest have become less and less common. aka less inter-device communication. Now, I didn't migrate my account over to google. Why? Because it would break EVERYTHING. My thermostat's temperature reading wouldn't be able to be used in order to turn on my ceiling fan automatically. Nest's away setting wouldn't be able to automatically turn off all lights in my home. etc etc. I do all of this with IFTTT, which google's account migration would kill.

So this is just with nest, i hear you say. Well, yea. The thermostat is a big deal in the home. its a central thing in every home. And this isn't just with the thermostat though, it would break ALL nest products. now, google wants it to work with their ""works with google assistant"" crap and routines, routines that are EXTREMELY limited in functionality. why? they claim ""security"". Except after the backlash they received, they announced they'd keep the works with nest thing going for the forseeable future. So much for security i guess, i think its just that they saw if they killed the program, people would en masse leave google. But since the WWN program is supposedly going to end at some point, new devices aren't being made with WWN, instead being hidden behind google's account, meaning no advanced automation skills nor the ability to work with IFTTT. 

Now google isn't the ONLY big player doing this. Amazon is also making things difficult on this front as well. But I see google as the one doing far more harm and setting far more precedent here. Amazon isn't blocking their products from working with google products. Google is breaking functionality on purpose so you buy nest products and are forced to use google's services. NOT ONLY THAT, but the functionality you do get is SEVERELY limited. I already listed a few things that you can't do anymore if you migrate to a google account from nest, and how routines are limited in functionality overall making automation much more of a pain to accomplish.

I know this isn't really about the google assistant itself, but honestly its about google's entire mindset on how these smart homes function. Everything is becoming walled off now. Devices have less functionality and ability to talk to one another. I have 3 google homes (a home and 2 home minis), a nest thermostat (with 3 temperature sensors), a bond hub (used to control two ceiling fans), and I was PLANNING on buying a nest indoor camera, some sort of security system with door sensors, a smart lock, etc. And yes I can get it all working under google's system, but its far more annoying than it would have been if google weren't making their entire ecosystem so walled. I can't use IFTTT to make customized integrations. I have to use google's limited and overly-simplified routines. Everything I had planned out in my head will take so many extra steps to get working now. Hell, i'll have to tell the google assistant to do a routine instead of it just happening on its own at certain times. I was going to set up a IFTTT recipe to lockdown the home at 1am every night; locking the front door, arming the security system, etc. Well under google, I can't do that now. I have to either manually do everything, or TELL the assistant to do the routine. It won't just happen on its own. And thats if the routine even wants to work, as i've tried it out and routines just dno't seem to work sometimes, and i've seen MANY complaints about routines breaking. 

Why break something that wasn't broken to begin with, google?

This destroys the entire concept of the smart home.  And google is part of why its dying, and will soon be dead.",t3_i4xxe2
4067,g0ltg1v,t3_i4xxe2,"I am at a loss. This is more of a Nest WiFi rant but it is affecting everything in my stupid ass Smart home. Setup ATT Fiber + Nest WiFi Router + 1 Point + Google Minis every room + bunch of random smart bulbs/cameras/Nest Hello. 

1. My Vizio TV and my Fire stick on a seperate TV stopped connecting on the same day. They both saw the network, showed up as connected, but couldn't connect to the net. I had to forget the network and rejoin on the Fire. My Vizio was worse, I could not for the life of me get it to reconnect, I ended up resetting my TV back to factory settings as it would not connect successfully to the WiFi. Note, they both had full strength WiFi and would get a valid IP address. Rebooting everything didn't help. 
2. WiFi speed, TVs typically connect just fine and stream HD just fine. So I know the connection is solid, but simultaneously I continue to have issues with iOS devices where pages/services either fail to load or CRAWL. If I switch to LTE and back to WiFi it usually resolves itself.
3. Continuous problems with smart devices around the house disconnecting, I think this may be related to the flaky WiFi. Garden continuously drops, GE light bulbs fail to connect, Ecobee, etc. 
4. When this is happening, if I open Google WiFi app, it often shows I have no devices connected to my network at all. Zero. Then after a few seconds they will load again. If I test my network and mesh everything thing comes up fantastic/super fast/amazing (800+ up and down)
5. Slow browsing. I typically use [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) but gave AT&T DNS the other day and it was an immediate improvement. So yay... one thing off the list. 
6. I am really disappointed in the range overall. I feel like I need to add another Point but I am hesitant to invest more in this system. My single Netgear covered the whole house and more. But, the Nest WiFi is faster (when it works).

- devices can't hear me when I'm right in front of them. I even turned up the sensitivity and still have to say ""hey google"" 5 times to get it to wake the f up.

- Hey google! I do not need to know you are turning something on or off!  Unless I ask for the weather or something...stfu!

Today I started reverse engineering the app putting it in a emulator and finally figured how to remove the zhombie.


I suggest you first try deleting all devices and home if it's an option and wait for a while to sync.

Don't delete home if you have nest devices and you pay for subscription.


If none of that helps then get a KitKat device or any older device and try to install an older version of home app.

You can also do that in an emulator. From here at the bottom you will see account general preference and you can see linked devices. 

Basically new app does not have that option. If you install new app in a newer version like I did, I did not see it still. I only saw that option in emulator KitKat with 2019 version of home app from apkmirror.

Plus, I have some custom routines that make use of uploaded sound files, so for example when I say ""Hey Google, red alert,"" my lights turn red and the siren from Star Trek: The Next Generation starts playing. So on a hunch, I asked my assistant to play the uploaded sound file (with the song name and artist I customized to work without any issue in GPM) from YTM just wondering if it would work once GPM disappears, and it started playing some heavy metal cover version of the siren sound instead of my uploaded file.",t3_i45hs8

There definitely is not a good way to search for uploaded music. I primarily use the app. This is probably the same as the browser version, but it is partitioned off in it's own tab. Which makes things easy to find...but it also separates it from the rest of the library in a way I don't like. I don't have too much uploaded music, so I didn't really think about wanting to find something in amongst a ton of other files.

4549,g0f88j6,t3_i3xwc4,"Ok, google, time for a rant ...

I would gladly switch over to Youtube Music, but here is why you are making it so difficult to do:

1. Youtube music is not available in South Africa as a default music service for Google Assistant! This is probably the biggest let down. I currently have Google Play Music set as my default google assistant music service, so when I ask google assistant to play music on my google speakers, it streams from play music. This happens well when I ask on the speaker, on my phone, on android tv and android auto. When google play music disappears for my country in September, I will not have the option to switch to youtube music as my default service, because it is not an option available to me. So I will have to go to Spotify, i guess? Now, there is an option to use traditional Youtube as my default music service, but if i select that and then ask google to play music, the following happens on different devices: on google speakers, it plays the video version and sends it to my TV; on my phone, it opens the Youtube app, not the YOutube music app; On android auto, it just blatently says that videos can't be played.

2. Android tv youtube music app is just a shortcut to the traditional android tv youtube app, and if I play music and then want to close the app so that the music can continue in the background, I am unable to, because it is just the usual youtube video app that is playing.

In summary, Play Music is being killed off in South Africa as one of the first countries, but we don't have Youtube Music available on google speakers, android auto and have a half-baked approach to Youtube Music on Android TV.

Thanks Google!",t3_i3xwc4

I don't care if they rebrand the existing app but YTM as-is is not a replacement for Google play music.

4553,g0fy197,t3_i3xwc4,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to be a disaster. Google's reasoning is so dumb. This is what happens when you make all your decisions based on metrics without studying the reasoning behind said metrics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasoning is simple. They have metrics that say a huge number of people visit YouTube to listen to music. And that's true. So they reason ""we've got this built-in base of people using YouTube for music, and a base of peopel using GPM; if we combine them, we'll be the #1 music provider in the world! MATH!""

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reason people use YouTube for music really boils down to lazyness, familiarity and fear of learning ""computer stuff."" You can hop on YouTube without logging in, search for a song and find it in some form of another. That's why people are using it for that.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those type of people? They're not going to switch to YouTube music. They're going to keep using regular YouTube for the same reason they're not using Spotify or anything else. They don't. Want. To change. They don't want to learn anything - regardless of how basic. They don't want an account. They want to go to the same place they've always gone and do what they've always done. There's a reason Yahoo still exists.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So forget about the YT users adopting YTM. As for the GPM users? Plenty are going to make the transition, but a whoooole lot are **not**. Google is losing them. As for people on other music services, forget it. GPM is better than YTM by a wide margin. If they're not jumping ship from Spotify to GPM, they're **damn** sure not doing it for YTM.

I'm blind and use a screen reader and it's pretty clear Spotify's accessibility is the result of a lawsuit or hasn't been audited in a very long time. Their sound quality is also worse than GPM. I keep running into song after song that sounds like shit compared to GPM. Why do so many songs on Spotify have garbage blown-out bass? I've heard that it's the desktop client, but I haven't sat down to do a quality coparison between mobile and desktop yet. They might be right.

And if I stop paying for YT premium and resume later, my price will go up. Google has the perfect music service. It's literally called ""play music"". How could you get more idiot-proof than that? It's literally named after the thing it does. I'm moving away from Google as much as I can, but again, there's no good alternative to youtube, so I guess I'll keep paying unless I find a way to block ads on iphone. I'm so tired of Google's shit. I'm tired of all the half-assed services that get cancelled after a few years. I'm so disappointed in their hardware.

I have no freaking clue how YTM decides which songs to play, but I find myself skipping them A LOT.  


I also had the option of selecting whether or not i wanted to watch the video with GPM. Since I cast my music for the most part, and since I have a high quality audio setup in a few rooms in my house, I want the best sound quality possible. YTM plays music videos by default with a widely varying level of audio quality, so my only option seems to be to completely disable videos (since music videos often have significantly worse sound quality).

4700,g0zvod0,t1_g0gy754,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further answer your question (because I just discovered this over the weekend when I tried to install the app on my nVidia Shield), there's no Android TV app. There's something that **calls** itself a YouTube Music app for Android TV in the store, but it turns out that it's literally just a shortcut to the ""music"" channel in the regular, existing YouTube app. That means you can't browse or search music **at all** unless it's a music video on YouTube, in which case it's highly likely that it's going to be very low-quality rip someone had from a VHS tape or something. You can't just browse plain-old music. Nor can you access anything you've uploaded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, whatever app you access it from, it insists on trying to merge YT and YTM. You get your playlists from both services mixed up because Google just decides that one of your YT playlist is musical. **And** I just learned that you can't edit the metadata of the songs you uploaded in YTM like you could in GPM. It's just a jumbled-up, very poorly conceived MESS that nobody likes, and the more I'm using it (which I'm **only** doing because I have a good amount of music not found on streaming services) the more things I'm finding that are poorly designed, poorly implemented or just plain broken.",t3_i3xwc4

I currently use about 14 Bluetooth, C by GE light bulbs. 2 are the tunable ones and the others are regular soft white. In order for my mini to control all of those I use a single GE smart plug w/ smart bridge to allow for control over wifi without a direct Bluetooth connection to the mini.

For my mini, I learned that I can only connect 6 Bluetooth devices (through Bluetooth) to the mini. While I was trying to connect bulbs past the 6 bulb limit, my issues were very similar to yours in the google home app. Only difference was that the home app could recognize the bulbs but could not connect to the bulb. It did not tell me what the issue was, it just said that something went wrong and the setup failed. This was the reason I got the smart plug/bridge. They all work fine now. 

How many Bluetooth devices are you using with your google home and what model of google home? May need to look up if there is any Bluetooth connection limit for your device if you are using a good amount of Bluetooth devices.",t3_i3t6av

How long did you wait before dismissing the group as ""not working""? I'm asking because I've noticed my google home mini almost always starts playing before the nests, as if he's on a faster connection. 

  
Could that be your problem maybe? Ofc, I'm talking about intervals of  **<** 5 seconds 

Another thing (and I don't mean to be condescending), do you remember telling them to play on ""name of the group""? I guess you do, but just to be sure we've covered it.

The last solution that comes to mind is making them play together using the app. i.e., start playing on one, and then switch to the group.

If nothing I've said applies to you, I'm honestly not sure what's the reason, but I can confirm 2 nests and a mini can work as a speaker group (as they should) so maybe try reconnecting them and making a new group.

If you've set them differently, one on 2.4, and the other on 4 or 5Hz, then they're technically not on the same wifi.

You can definitely set 2 wifis connections on your router so try placing all three of them on the 2.4 connection and then see. If that works, try setting them on the 5G so at least you know you can use them on one of the frequencies.

I doubt it's a matter of wired vs wireless and more first party vs third party. Unless you are saying your wired ADT sensors previously installed aren't allowed in.

For me the Nest was my first entry into security and the biggest perk was wife factor. Her company pays our bill from T-Mobile and Nest Secure was sold at T-Mobile. We got the security system and an indoor camera fully paid for us over 2 years and now that its paid off the ongoing Nest Aware subscription for that camera is free. Even after converting to Google's new subscription. The downtime can be frustrating but its been so rare and they've refunded us every time.

Plus, I work for a company that provides enterprise level surveillance and security so I have those cameras mounted elsewhere. If I need to identify someone from my Nest cameras I can just run an appearance search in that system haha",t3_i2vm85

So ditched the ADT/ST hub and went gen3 and can use the wired and any wireless sensors I have to use smart home monitoring through the hub.  Which doesn’t have ability to call police for me, but alerts me/can set off the wired siren.

I think Nest makes better products and apps than Ring, period. I think Ring and Simplysafe make better apps, better cameras, and better or on par products with ADT, with the possible exception of ADTs newest baystation, which while better in terms of being something of a smart hub wall mounted tablet, is several hundred dollars all by itself. 

The big problem with both ADT and Nest is their subscription price being 3-5x's that of their competition. The smaller problems with ADT are that the rest of their product line and their app are poor compared to substantially cheaper competition, and they sell you those poor products via kids on commission that walk up and down your neighborhood in the summer. The smaller problem with Nest is costs on top of the already high annual subscription. It's worth a price premium, sure, but $100 for each smoke alarm? The 24/7 20mbs per camera video requirement with no ""only motion"" options is also a huge tax on your bandwidth, and basically limits the product to only people on fiber. 

So while you can sort of excuse Nest, since they are offering a better product line, maybe they're targeting the more premium market, there's nothing that excuses ADT. And it's a hard argument to say Nest is worth $350/year more than Simply safe or $400-500/year more than Ring.

I'd agree that Ring may not have surpassed ADT in customer base, we don't know because they're not specific enough.

I hope that the Google partnership with ADT is for the best. Certainly ADT could use much lower prices, much better products, no more contracts, and some real help with their terrible Pulse app. But I'm pessimistic after how little Google did to bring Brinks pricing into this century.",t3_i2vm85

I noticed you dropped 11 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Once you tell it to shut up/cancel it says, ""Ok, just ask for the secret menu if you want to come back."" For whatever reason, when it says ""Ok"" it says it with two different voices at the same time which sounds creepy! So when I when I first told it to shut up and it said ""Ok"" in a possessed voice like that I was a little freaked out.

There's just one problem though; if you want to use the remote of your stereo system only to adjust the volume you will have to turn the volume of the Nest Mini all the way up, resulting in the Google Assistant shouting at you.

Edit: Try picking up a used Chromecast Audio on eBay if you still can. Bluetooth has inferior audio quality as you probably know, so a Wi-Fi alternative would probably be best.

In principle when you give a Harmony voice command to GH the first time (on that day) you have to name the device concerned. Providing your next voice  command is for the same device you don't have to repeat the device name again You can get around this by creating a routine to give the instruction.

It could be almost anything; electrical interference, high-pitched whine from electrical equipment, plumbing, you name it.

It might be intermittent and occur only at night, or it might just be that it's only quiet enough at night that it's not swamped by other background noises and the Home can pick it up.

I'd try:

* Swapping your Home for another Home from another room (if you have one) that doesn't do it to rule out a problem with the device itself.
* Leaving something on in the room overnight that makes a low level of noise to see if it's really intermittent, or just needs the room to be quiet enough for the Home to detect it.
* Moving the home to other rooms to see if you can localise the source of the signal.
* Turning off *all* electrical equipment in the room each night, then turning one thing back on each (few) night(s) (depending how often it usually occurs) until it starts happening again.

5310,fzzfwuo,t1_fzzbec1,"Wake-word detection is also prone to a lot more false positives than normal command-word detection, again because it's done in the device instead of in the cloud.

As far as I'm aware there's no cloud-based wake-word detection confirmation, either; there are wake words (""ok Google""/""hey Google"") that are detected and recognised locally on the device and immediately switch it into command-input mode, and commands that are recorded, compressed and uploaded to the server for cloud-based recognition.

Since wake-word detection is a binary true/false and the cost of false positives is close to zero, there's no reason to incur the delay of a round-trip to the server to confirm whether or not the detection was correct before the device even starts uploading audio data to the server for (free-form, open ended) command-detection.

I strongly suspect the glass-smash detection works the same way - it's likely just listening out for a bunch of evenly-distributed high frequencies that aren't usually caused by anything else that can easily be identified on the device, so there isn't necessarily any point in building out a whole back-end detection API linked to (but distinct from) their existing voice-to-text one just for that.

I might be wrong, but with all the urban legends about Facebook apps listening to ambient sound through mobile device mics (etc) Google are also highly careful not to start streaming audio data out of your house without the device clearly indicating it's detected a wake-word and thinks you're talking to it, specifically to offset that.

Pushing audio data to the server to confirm wake-word (or glass-smashing) detection before switching to command-input mode and flashing the device lights to tell the user is listening acting would violate that and positively *invite* more paranoid conspiracy theories about their product.",t3_i1p5pz

At the same time, they upload the snippet of the wake word to confirm that they did in fact hear the wake word. When Google confirms that they did, they upload everything to Google to process. If they didn't hear the wake word (false alarm), the rest of the recording is scrapped and never uploaded.

My best proof of this for now is that sometimes you'll see the device perk up (lights on), then it will quietly go back to sleep, even when I'm not done talking. This is usually during false activations, though sometimes happens when I'm actually trying to talk to it.",t3_i1p5pz

Plug in your Google Home and wait until it seems done booting up, it will still be in a non-working state, but you should be able to adjust the volume to check if it's on. 4. Factory reset your device twice. For some reason two times is the charm. The first time you factory reset it seems that the Google Home can fail, so people have been having luck with two times. 5. With your Wi-Fi network still off, on your phone open the Home app and find your trouble Google Home from nearby devices. 6. Setup your Google Home and then when it asks to connect to Wi-Fi turn on your Wi-Fi network and finish setup.

5548,fzvoi0y,t1_fztyrun,"Tell me more about this Ethernet switcher and what PoE means.

I have a six-port Ethernet switcher and I guess I have a question about these devices in general: does splitting one Ethernet input so many ways not result in a noticeable decrease in connection performance? I'm not so worried about using a switcher for smart home stuff, but should you be connecting game and video streaming to a switcher?",t3_i11hfi
5549,fzu3ssx,t1_fzu2nkh,"The specs say something like ""up to 50 lights"".  As you might imagine every accessory like switch or motion sensor counts toward that budget, but more strangely the scenes associated with each room also count.  I think I was about 30 some lights and a couple switches at the time.  To add more lights in the interem deleting some of the default scenes from certain rooms would clear up enough space.

The top of the fridge was just a convenient spot for the rack since some wiring was already coming together there.",t3_i11hfi
5550,fzu4anb,t1_fzu3w2n,"I find it annoying there's no indication of capacity, when you're getting close etc.   Just when you try to finally add the one-too-many you get a bridge is full error message.

I reached out to philips and their response claimed technical limitations to keep things responsive enough.  I don't claim to be a zigbee exert but the concept that a scene, which if basically send these attribute commands to these devices, needs to be 1) duplicated for every 'room' or 2) that actual storage space for something that's literally measured in bytes need be any kind of limiting factor...  well what ever.

When I placed the order for a new one I ordered an extra as well in case I filled this one or if one of them dies.  Dislike potential hub failure being a single point of failure for all (or half) of my lights.",t3_i11hfi
5551,fzvprld,t1_fzvoi0y,"There's probably a lot of YT videos explaing how switches work way better than I could do in a comment here.  Suffice it to say though, each port will send traffic to the port it needs to go to, and takes care of learning where stuff lives.

Now if you have a switch plugged into a switch plugged into a switch, there's going to be a non zero latency involved.  However that's largely just an academic point for a home network and wouldn't affect you any to worry about performance issues from that.

I hardwired everything from TVs, game consoles, streaming sticks that generally isn't moving around and doesnt 'need wifi' to keep the airwave traffic cleared for devices that really do it it.

PoE means powerd over Ethernet.  Some switches support sending additional electrical power to physicially power up the device they're sending data to.  Think other network switches, cameras.  All the smart hubs i have in that picture and raspberry pi don't support PoE natively, but I got PoE splitters that Y out into data only ethernet and a DC barrel or usb power plug so I didn't need all their individual bulky power bricks in the tiny cabinet.

A Google speaker is a thousand times more complicated, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that they implemented this simple technology that doesn't require remote processing.  Even smoke detectors on a (modern, addressable) fire alarm require the panel to make a decision on whether there's fire, but glassbreaks are about as simple as they get with respect to microphones and sound processing.",t3_i0chih

5778,fzp8kzl,t1_fzojikq,"Could be sub-sensory differences between real-world sounds and sound reproduction tech (compression algorithms *and/or* hardware) meant for human ears. Breaking glass probably has a large proportion of hypersonic detail.

That is to say, human ears can't hear above a given frequency, so even *lossless* sound reproduction cannot record above a given frequency (essentially half its sampling rate). Lossy compression also removes sounds that humans will not *conditionally* hear, based on context, and furthermore will prioritize audible defects according to whatever formulation justifies a given format's existence well enough.

—Though the usual goal, especially nowadays, is to reduce literal post-compression bitrate while keeping the sound “transparent”, i.e. free of generally noticeable defects. Still, though, I've found that complex high-frequency sounds (usually cymbals) suffer worst in compressed audio—at least as is still commonly found in at least the common, lingering compression formats.

Something to note is that recognition of the ""wake words"" for a Google Home is performed client side, or on the hardware itself. As soon as it is detected, it will start transmitting what you say to Google.

Alexa, on the other hand, performs the ""wake word"" detection server side, so as soon as it hears anything it starts beaming everything to Amazon. I've had friends tell me that they can simply tell if someone is in a room based on the amount of network traffic their Alexa is using.",t3_i0chih

5800,fzpsds3,t1_fzp8kzl,"That's an interesting theory, but consumer grade microphones typically have the same frequency response as humans, around 25-30hz to 15-20khz, depending on the quality of the mic, sometimes even more narrow for cheap voice detection mics. I don't see Google using much more expensive mics for the purposes of just detecting glass breakage on these relatively cheap devices. 

More than likely it has to do with the acoustic properties and the compression you mentioned (which can still be detected by human ears in lower quality recordings). Any fire alarm recorded and played back already has an echo and harmonics baked into the recording, so even played back at a loud volume it will sound different from a genuine fire alarm going off in your home, plus it will take in the characteristics of whatever cheap speakers you're using. Unless you have cranked up reference studio monitors and a super clean, uncompressed signal, it's probably pretty easy to detect the difference to a trained ear.",t3_i0chih

So here's what I did...I had been using optical out, I switched to HDMI ARC on the soundbar and my TV and moved my Google Chromecast Ultra to the HDMI in on my Vizio Soundbar. I figured I could use the Chromecast on my group and that would work...and to be fair it was, however I had major issues with a delay on the soundbar (not sure how as I ran both the bar AND ultra on Ethernet and I have gigabit connection). After this, while still connected to HDMI ARC, I went into Google Home and on the lists was my device again... I have NO clue what exactly caused this to work again, but now it's working and steaming with speaker groups with absolutely no delay and lists the device, which was my main issue.

They made GChat because their biggest rivals had a chat program built into their email client, Yahoo Messenger. They migrated to Hangouts because Google Plus was trying to compete with Facebook. Now Yahoo mail is basically dead and Google Plus is actually dead, so why invest in chat? Because of the users? Not good enough.

Music is not a big enough part of Google's business model for me to trust them to keep it going. It was created to compete with Apple Music, but now it isn't a major selling point of Android with all the competition in the music space.

After GPM is gone, I will switch to a company whose entire business model depends on providing a good music platform, because I know they will never make the conscious decision to just stop doing that. (Probably Spotify)

I switched to Discord when they ended Hangouts. I'm not sure what I'll do if they ever stop providing Google Assistant for Home, but at least that business unit sells hardware, so it's probably pretty safe for now.

I'm tired of being jerked around by Google's internal business fads and when they decide to drop something, I'm going to find a company whose survival is dependent on providing the best product they can. Not one who's just in it for ulterior motives.",t3_i00j3d

>Can you show me why Spotify isn't better at everything by default after GPM is shut down?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we're talking about Google's music platforms as a whole, then yes, I can. Because YouTube music will be providing the same functionality I mentioned, which means that **it** offers something that Spotify is completely incapable of doing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because this isn't functionality that **you** use doesn't mean it's not of considerable value to a **lot** of other people; which means the statement that ""Spotify is better at everything"" is, and will continue to be, objectively, factually, demonstrably false.",t3_i00j3d

I have tinkered around a little bit and found this:

First off - I have my google home default play to a speaker group (chromecast audio + google home) It's been working fine for years, until recently, maybe 2-3 months ago.

1. If I say ""play X music"" it will say, ""Okay, playing X music on speaker group"". then nothing happens.

Very strange. The device is capable of playing the music on the speaker group, but for whatever reason it doesn't want to.

I've tried rebooting google home/chromecast, resetting them as well, I've tried making new groups, I've tried unlinking and linking my spotify accounts.

6148,fzlpb12,t1_fzknhzy,"My best theory (as a software developer) is that once Home receives a recognised text string from the voice-reignition service, it sends out a request to every content-providing service and external device it knows about that might be even vaguely associated with keywords in the request, with a *really* strict timeout to ensure timely replies.

If a device or service responds a little too slowly (or your local network is temporarily congested and some responses can't get through), it won't be able to choose the best answer, so instead it falls back on the least-shitty one that responded in the time limit (which is usually crappy because you're usually expecting a response from a specific app or device), or even just gives up with a generic ""I don't understand that/I can't do that"" error message.

This is pure speculation, but it would reasonably explain:

* Why sometimes commands just start giving abnormal responses for long periods (server or device downtime)
* Why sometimes rebooting a client device can get Home taking to it properly again (slow-running/crashed devices often get faster/respond to commands at all again after a reboot)
* Why two identical commands issued seconds apart and both correctly recognised can give completely different results (temporary network congestion or slow response from one responder)
* Why sometimes a cast command will succeed, but then Google Home still reports the command as failing (command received by client device, but its confirmation response takes too long so Home assumes the command failed even though the device has successfully started playing the media you want)
* Why the more Google Home-enabled devices you have on your network the more buggy and error-prone the ecosystem seems to get (more competing network traffic, not chance something's responding slowly)",t3_hznz2a
6149,fzmdnng,t1_fzknhzy,"It’s not the first time I’ve read this theory, it could be the case.

6180,fzj368v,t3_hzhnka,Speaker groups are all good for me.,t3_hzhnka
6181,fzj5ul4,t3_hzhnka,"Speaker groups work fine for me, the only exception is playing it on my Chromecast. It is usually out of sync in comparison to the Google homes and Chromecast audio",t3_hzhnka
6182,fzj5xmp,t3_hzhnka,"The problem likely lies in your network. I use speaker groups daily, a mix of home and chromecast devices, without any issues.",t3_hzhnka
6183,fzjresa,t1_fzj5f9d,"Yeah, disconnecting the speakers ""solved"" the issue. It makes the edifier bluetooth speaker a bit pointless though. I was hoping to use the them for better sound in the livingroom than what the little Nexus Hub makes.",t3_hzhnka
6184,fzll95z,t1_fzjresa,Yea I tried it myself for a while but eventually gave up on using Bluetooth in a group.,t3_hzhnka
6185,fziay53,t3_hze2ua,His name is Tim Apple,t3_hze2ua
6186,fziesx5,t3_hze2ua,"100% up to Apple at this point. 

YouTube music let’s you use Google cast OR airplay, so I can use my Google home Max or HomePod. 

The same cannot be said for the HomePod/Apple Music where no Google Cast icon can be found anywhere... (not sure if the Google cast icon is on the android version of Apple Music).",t3_hze2ua
6187,fzjxsr0,t3_hze2ua,"Maybe start by digging up Steve Jobs.

Don't think it's gonna help, but seeing his corpse anally violated would funny as hell.",t3_hze2ua
6188,fzka87r,t3_hze2ua,This please,t3_hze2ua
6189,fzimaas,t1_fziesx5,"Yes, the Apple Music app does have the cast icon. Works great on Home, with gapless playback. And while you can't cast from iTunes on the PC, the website for Apple Music is essentially just a web-based version of iTunes, so you just cast from Chrome. 

All that's missing is the direct integration into Google Home",t3_hze2ua
6190,fzj5wfr,t3_hzdnyg,"You can't stop Autoplay.    
Playing your own playlists by voice is not yet available on YTM.",t3_hzdnyg
6191,fzigq2q,t3_hzbqzx,"First and most important tip I can give you is to make sure that if you want any kind of privacy/security for your home devices then make sure no one else has access to your wifi.

Currently, anyone with access to your wifi and has the home app installed can go in and access the functions of your devices. i.e. playing an annoying song at full volume at 2 in the morning, turning devices (lights, tv) on and off, etc.",t3_hzbqzx
6192,fzi6jx2,t3_hzbqzx,Umm... Keep your expectations low???,t3_hzbqzx
6193,fzigs32,t3_hzbqzx,This is just a beginning. You'll end up getting more.,t3_hzbqzx
6194,fzj6bzs,t3_hzbqzx,Welcome! See the helpful links in the sidebar. Especially for setting up your device and commands to try.,t3_hzbqzx
6195,fzjhv6z,t3_hzbqzx,Get an Alexa just to compare functionality with Google Home,t3_hzbqzx
6196,fzjp2v6,t3_hzbqzx,How long until you decide to discover the power of True Home Automation? :D,t3_hzbqzx
6197,fzk5b0m,t3_hzbqzx,"""sorry, something went wrong, try again in a few min"" - get used to hearing that from all of your devices. 🤦🏽‍♂️ Don't get me wrong I love it but it can get so frustrating at times. Just asking it to play something.",t3_hzbqzx
6198,fziexzq,t1_fzi6jx2,"Really?  I’ve been very pleased with the Google home setup we have (nest cams, chromecasts, minis, hubs, etc)

It’s not 100% perfect but it’s pretty close.",t3_hzbqzx
6199,fzif8ar,t1_fziexzq,I'm kinda joking. I've also been extremely happy with mine. I do see lots of complaints on here though and most of the negativity seems to come from people who expect Google Assistant to be able to do something it wasn't designed to do.,t3_hzbqzx
6200,fziff2h,t1_fzif8ar,"Oh yeah without a doubt. 

Some of these folks need to try Bixbi or Siri once or twice to see how good we have it.",t3_hzbqzx

6204,fzjhcwr,t3_hz803a,I played this near my a Google nest mini and it activated and played the same response yours did,t3_hz803a
6205,fzjcxq1,t3_hz803a,Didn't work for me either,t3_hz803a
6206,fzjm7hy,t3_hz803a,Mine heard me play the video and it triggered the same response.,t3_hz803a
6207,fzjrf79,t3_hz803a,Worked for me,t3_hz803a
6208,fzjv5hh,t3_hz803a,Worked on my Samsung phone,t3_hz803a

6211,fzkdwx2,t3_hz803a,Nice!  Works on all my devices.,t3_hz803a
6212,fzlf0y0,t3_hz803a,What should I say to check?,t3_hz803a
6213,fzj9ij7,t1_fzj4bar,Hmm. Maybe they need an update? Or maybe mine is out of date?,t3_hz803a
6214,fzjj96b,t1_fzjhcwr,Yeah my nest hub just did this as well.,t3_hz803a
6215,fzjzdfv,t1_fzjhcwr,Lol same,t3_hz803a
6216,fzjmmpo,t1_fzjm7hy,"Interesting, so far the comments are a 50/50 split on whether it worked for them or not.",t3_hz803a

6221,fzhc9wo,t3_hz6r4p,Buy yourself a travel router. Set up your own network using the apartment wifi. Search the sub. It's been posted about by every college student or apartment renter using shared networks.,t3_hz6r4p
6222,fzhny5t,t3_hz6r4p,You should be more worried about your ridiculously insecure setup and what personal data is being viewed by your tech savvy neighbours.,t3_hz6r4p

6224,fzhmmrp,t3_hz6r4p,"This shouldn't be possible unless you are on some sort of shared network. If you are on your own network, make sure you turn off the the ""Let others control your cast media"" setting, but as others said, you should definitely isolate your network from others in the apartment building for many security reasons, not just this.",t3_hz6r4p

6227,fzj802f,t3_hz6r4p,Are they connecting via Bluetooth or does your apartment building share the network with all tenants?,t3_hz6r4p
6228,fzif86x,t1_fzh7qra,"Ours was the exact same way. 

Landlord had one giant antenna that served hundreds of residents.

Even worse was we were on the same subnet.  So as soon as we reached 255 users on at once, you couldn’t connect.

I could see network printers, Roku boxes, fire sticks, consoles, phones, etc.",t3_hz6r4p
